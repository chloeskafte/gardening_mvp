Introduction
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live 
But to the earth some special good doth give
Romeo and Juliet
W hen I moved into our Canberra house, the large 
vegetable garden was a daunting prospect. To neg­
lect such a large and well-presented garden with its 
neat concrete paths and terracing would have been 
a shame, for the labour already invested in it would 
be wasted. The prospect of fruit and vegetable 
harvests made it seem worthwhile. So began the 
years of trying to tame the vegetable plot. Is it pos­
sible to have a reasonably well-organised, continu­
ally productive, minimum care vegetable garden 
and, at the same time, run family, house and job?
I'he first three years saw stormy battles with 
weeds and their allies the spades, with pests, chem ­
ical fertilisers and insecticides, poor harvests of 
some vegetables at the same time as absurdly large 
harvests of others, including weeds and more 
weeds. Frustration, impatience, unreasonably high 
expectations, a bad back during one season and an 
increasingly harassed family meant that the garden 
was not the pleasure it was supposed to be.
Hoping that knowledge would somehow reduce 
the actual work, I read the books: the seeders and 
weeders, the compost mulchers, the companion 
planters, the meditators, the diviners and the 
organic gardeners. I tried most of them. Finally I 
decided to stop worrying. My garden management 
program  satisfies all the original hopes: the garden 
is under control and can be managed by one per­
son with minimum time and effort, the fruit and 
vegetable harvests are good, the garden produces 
throughout winter, there is no need for chemical 
fertilisers and insecticides, and I can cope with the 
garden produce in the kitchen without hours of 
pickling, bottling or freezing.
The garden now includes a chicken run. T hat 
solved a lot of niggling problems about gardens, 
soil fertility and food production. Battery eggs are 
not appealing and home grown eggs taste better. 
Long term soil fertility will depend on what goes 
back into the soil and chicken manure is quite a 
bonus. So the chicken run is movable and every six 
months or so, the chickens are moved to another 
garden bed. One of the delightful benefits has 
been the children’s interest in them.
Don’t make mistakes yourself — learn from 
mine. I offer my experiences to those in the 
Canberra region who want a productive garden 
without the backbreaking labour and the trying, 
repetitive procedures of intensive horticulture. 
From the garden to the table is not as simple as it 
seems either; most gardeners I know hand their 
harvests to the cook. So the recipes are included to 
help the gardener-cook prepare the vegetables for 
f amily and f riends with little fuss, more variety and 
great pleasure.
I don’t think the vegetable garden saves me 
money: the fruit and vegetables markets may well 
be cheaper than the combined cost of mulch, m an­
ure, seeds, seedlings, fertilisers and labour. How­
ever, I am often suspicious of the unblemished 
shape and shine of the market vegetables, perhaps 
they conceal more.insecticides and chemicals than 
they ought.
W inifred’s vegetable garden is a delight: intelli­
gent planning, great diversity and incredible crops. 
O ur gardens grew together, satisfying different 
needs but developing similar low maintenance 
techniques. Neither of us expects extraordinary 
crops of beautiful vegetables but what we do get 
from our efforts pleases us. O ur gardens may not 
be the biggest or the best but they do produce what 
we want them to.
Nobody else’s garden harvest can match your 
own, so try growing your own. Use the deep mulch 
technique but make the garden the way you want it 
and join the Organic G ardening and Farming Soc­
iety of the A.C.T. in the meantime. T here is always 
next season to try something else.

ORGANIC GARDENING
Gardening, like medicine, science and education, 
needs demystifying. For the intending home gar­
dener, particularly the part-time gardener, inten­
sive horticulture is an intimidating, almost occult 
process bound by shadowy rules about bed prep­
aration, cultivation, transplanting, fertilising and 
spray formulae for disease and pest control. 
Organic gardeners, too, must beware of unwit­
tingly sliding into a similar state of confusion about 
com panion planting, comfrey, the mysteries of 
compost and dem anding cultivation practices.
There is no mystery about organic gardening. It 
merely means managing a garden by using fertilis­
ers and mulches derived from ‘natural’ or ‘living’ 
m atter. It means building up the fertility of the soil 
by returning organic material to it, through recycl­
ing the kitchen and garden wastes, animal m an­
ures, spoiled straw or hay, compost, seaweed, saw­
dust or pulverised rock, like rock phosphate. It 
means using managem ent techniques like sheet or 
deep mulching, composting, companion planting, 
or creating a ‘no-dig’ garden; or it can be part o f a 
larger scheme like permaculture.
Im proving soil fertility is of fundam ental im por­
tance to organic gardeners, it is the common 
thread among them, whether their com m itm ent is 
intellectual, pragmatic or spiritual, whether they 
are at one with the Divine, with M other Nature or 
the fairy ring, or whether they are advocates of 
scientific ecology, conservation or self-sufficiency.
Since Adam delved all gardens were organic and 
most of the world’s gardens are still organic. Only 
in the industrialised countries has the scientific
revolution brought the magic formula of NPK, nit­
rogen, phosphorus and potassium, to agriculture 
and the suburban back-yard. It seemed that if these 
chemicals were applied regularly to the soil in their 
convenient powdered form they would meet the 
needs of growing plants and achieve indefinite soil 
fertility. Plant growth can be remarkable in re­
sponse to the added chemicals but long term soil 
fertility has declined because the complex struc­
ture and micro-organic life of the soil has been 
disrupted 
and, 
unless 
revived 
by 
fallowing, 
destroyed.
Organic gardening in its m odern guise was a 
reaction to ‘scientific agriculture’. It was first 
popularised by Sir Albert Howard, an English 
agricultural adviser to the Indian state of Indore. 
He developed, partly from necessity, animal hus­
bandry and agricultural techniques without the use 
of expensive chemicals. He argued that chemical 
farm ing was ‘fragm entation’, that soil fertility was 
more than the sum of its minerals and chemicals, 
that it was possible to preserve long term soil fertil­
ity by returning plant or animal wastes to the soil, 
that insects could be controlled by non-poisonous 
means, and that good soil would have enough nu­
trients for growing plants without concentrated 
chemical fertilisers and their toxic residues.
Winifred and I use organic gardening tech­
niques because they have worked best for us. Early 
experience in the garden using traditional cultiva­
tion practices with chemical fertilisers and insec­
ticides did not produce perfect vegetables. The ex­
pense of fertilisers, a deep suspicion of insecticides, 
backbreaking labour and our failures made us con­
sider alternatives that would increase the chances 
of good harvests without great effort.
O ur early solutions were similar: sum m er gar­
dening with its watering problems meant using 
mulch. But we found that all types of mulching 
were not effective. Green mulching with grass 
clippings was inadequate, compost mulching took 
too much time, a lot of effort with never enough 
compost, while straw mulching produced crops of 
weeds and grass. O ur final solution came with that
1

--- Page 10 ---
great incentive, lack of time, and deep mulching 
with spoilt hay or straw has solved weeding, fertil­
ity, watering, time and heavy labour problems.
The part-time gardener should convert lack of 
time into a virtue so that the guiding principle for 
the garden should be benign neglect: prepare the 
garden, plant the seed, do a little prudent 
maintenance and leave it be. The part-time garden 
will do the rest.
H um us
Organic gardeners concentrate on improving soil 
fertility. This depends on a complex interaction of 
minerals, microbes, fungi, algae, earthworms and 
plants. But mostly it depends on humus.
Humus is decomposed organic matter: compost 
is humus, decomposed leaf litter on the forest floor
Yp ' H
is humus. The animal and microbe populations in 
the soil are responsible for converting the organic 
m atter to the dark and crumbly m ixture which 
improves the soil’s water-holding capacity and in­
creases the supply and availability of nutrients dur­
ing and after its decomposition.
It used to be thought in the eighteenth century 
that hum us was the source of all plant food. Mod­
ern chemistry proved that plant growth was 
dependent on inorganic com pounds but the 
hum us theory still holds, with some modifications: 
those necessary inorganic compounds are in the 
hum us after microbial action has broken down the 
organic materials, and in the humus medium they 
are available to the plants. For long term soil fertil­
ity, gardeners have to rely on humus, not the for­
mula fertilisers because they do not have organic 
m atter in them.

DEEP MULCHING
Gardening by deep mulching is a balanced and 
conservative method of gardening because at the 
same time as growing plants are using the soil’s 
fertility, that fertility is replenished by the decom­
posing mulch.
Mulch is, simply, any protective ground covering 
around plants. It has been a technique used for 
hundreds of years for crop and tree protection but 
its use in domestic gardens is relatively recent.
Provided the mulch is deep enough to bamboozle 
weed seeds, there are very distinct advantages in
deep mulching for the gardener, particularly those 
with little time.
They are . . .
For the gardener
•  digging and cultivation are now unnecessary; 
weeding is reduced to an incidental chore as
•  the few weeds that do emerge can easily be 
pulled out;
•  watering the garden is not such a hit and miss 
business;
•  using fertilisers is unnecessary after the deep 
mulch system is established.

The Mulch — Spoiled Hay or Straw
The most effective deep mulch is spoiled hay or 
straw.
Hay: Any grass or other plant like clover or 
lucerne that is cut and dried for animal fodder. 
The first cut is the superior cut with higher nut­
rient value than subsequent cuts and it may be seed 
free, both of the crop and of weeds. First cut hay is 
relatively expensive ($1.00 to $5.50 or more pet- 
bale).
Straw: The stubble or stalks left after a harvest of 
cereal crops, baled for use as fodder. There are 
likely to be seeds in the bales. Straw is cheaper than 
hay ($1.00 to $1.50 per bale).

Use hay or straw according to the state of your 
pocket, their availability, and the condition of your 
soil.
Hay and straw bales, and sometimes spoiled 
bales, are available in Canberra either from pro­
duce merchants or from local farm ers advertising 
in The Canberra Times. Look in the pets and live­
stock or garden supplies columns. Prices are lowest 
in late summer.
Spoiling Bales
Leave the new bales in the open for a couple of 
months, turning every now and then so that each 
surface will be exposed to sun and rain. Leave 
them on a garden bed that is not in use or is being 
prepared so that the earthworm s can begin their 
work immediately.
T here are two good reasons for spoiling bales:
1. Germination or seed spoiling is encouraged 
and any grass that does grow on the bale is 
killed as the bale is rotated.
2. During the first few weeks of rotting, the hay 
and straw produces toxins that inhibit plant 
growth including the growth of weeds. The 
toxicity can last a few' weeks.
How to Use the Mulch
Spread spoiled straw or hay over dam p soil in thick 
layers. You do not have to dig. Ignore weeds, just 
spread the straw or hay over them. To begin with, 
make the layers about 15 to 20 cm (b to 8 in.) thick. 
As they rot and pack down they will need building 
up once a year.
4

--- Page 13 ---
Do not dig the straw or hay into the soil . . .  it is 
quite unnecessary work, the earthworms will do a 
better job.
If the organic material is incorporated into the 
soil, bacteria in the soil will use the available nitro­
gen in the f resh or partly decayed material to break

that material down before making nitrogen avail­
able to plants. T here is, therefore, a tem porary 
shortage of nitrogen for plant growth.
Use any organic material to build up the mulch 
such as grass clippings, newspapers, pine needles, 
cotton rags, autum n leaves, sawdust, animal m an­
ures, kitchen waste, garden refuse and compost. 
It’s an aesthetic decision that determines whether it 
will go on top of or under the mulch.
When you are familiar with the procedure you 
can juggle the equation to suit your own situation 
— if a garden bed is to be fallow over winter, fresh 
straw or first-cut lucerne can be laid very thickly 
over the bed provided they are relatively free of 
seeds. If you get a good crop of lucerne, chop it 
with a spade and cover it with spoilt bales — it will 
be useful as a green manure.
Remember:
• seeds in the mulch mean trouble, germinate 
them in the bale;
• mulch must be thick;
• fresh straw has a short-term  toxicity for grow­
ing plants;
• use only organic materials for mulch.
5

--- Page 14 ---
Other Mulches to Use with Spoiled Straw or Hay
Grass clippings are rich in nitrogen and potash. 
They convert quickly into hum us but spread 
them thinly otherwise they will become a slimy 
mess.
Leaves are useful in mulch and compost, but they 
need some added blood and bone to increase the 
nitrogen level. In autum n and winter the 
D epartm ent of the Capital Territory allows the 
public to collect fallen leaves from public parks. 
‘Composted’ straw from poultry farmers, horse 
stables and dairy farms has the benefit of a straw 
or sawdust litter mixed with the animal m anure, 
an invaluable fertiliser for the garden. T he ma­
nures are not truly composted, they are merely 
aged, and may contain seeds.
Pine needles are easy to collect from the pine 
forests. They are acid so they need some lime. 
Sawdust is a good mulch but be careful not to 
apply fresh sawdust too thickly to the vegetable 
patch. Use old sawdust and collect it from timber 
millers in Queanbeyan. Some people add a 
couple of handfuls of blood and bone to every 
square metre of sawdust mulch for extra nitro­
gen.
Paper and newspaper are good mulch materials if 
other sources of mulch are not very productive. 
Lead is not used in newsprint ink but there are 
lead components in coloured inks. As paper is 
quite slow to break down, it is very effective in 
layers of three or four sheets over weeds and 
under the mulch. T he layer should not be too 
thick or it may prevent water penetrating to the 
soil.
Wastes from the kitchen and garden. Put them 
straight under the mulch. Be sensible about 
whether they should rightly be in the indolent 
compost (p. 16) for there may be bones or very 
large things in it that may take a long time to 
break down.
Does all this seem too complicated with seed 
germination, straw toxicity and early nitrogen de­
privation?
In practice deep mulching is remarkably simple 
garden m anagem ent with three great virtues: low 
labour gardening, low maintenance gardening and 
self-fertilising gardening.
In Chapter 3 there are ways of converting your 
vegetable garden and starting your garden from 
scratch.
MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE
M anagement and m aintenance of a deep mulch 
garden are a m atter of common sense and indi­
vidual style touched with some sympathy for grow­
ing plants and their needs.
Seeding
Use any of the following methods but tor very tine 
seeds, sow them in areas cleared of mulch:
Clear an area of mulch, plant the seed in the soil 
and return the mulch around the plant when it is 
strong and healthy.
Sow the seeds in a couple of handfuls of soil or 
compost on top of the mulch.
6

--- Page 15 ---
Sow seeds a few inches below the surface of the 
mulch where there is enought moisture for germ i­
nation.
Remember that seeds need constant moisture 
for good germination. All these methods have 
worked; however, the first two methods usually 
germinate more seeds.
Transplanting
Clear areas of mulch for transplanting seedlings so 
that the mulch does not touch the seedlings when 
they are transplanted. Seedlings should be healthy 
and large. When the plants are well established and 
growing vigorously, return the mulch.
Spacing
Random planting or straight line planting is an 
aesthetic decision. If you are undecided about 
spacing between individual plants, refer to seed 
packets or the instructions with seedlings. The 
spacing decision is not critical to the success of any 
vegetable.
Mixed Planting
Do not feel bound by feelings of orderliness and 
neatness. Mixed plantings o f vegetables, including 
a few flowers here and there, reduce the problem 
of pests and diseases attacking the whole crop. 
Pests which attack in one area of your garden may 
ignore similar vegetables in other areas.
Planting in rows made cultivation easier; mulch removes 
that chore so planting can be random
Crop Residues
W hen your harvest is over, break off the plant at its 
base and leave it tp rot. You can put it under the 
mulch or leave it to decompose on the top. Remove 
only those plants that are diseased.
Fertilisers
To build up soil fertility with organic material can 
take some time, so use a complete fertiliser, like a 
seaweed fertiliser, to prom ote good plant growth 
in the meantime.
7

deeply to penetrate the mulch and to encourage 
deep rooting in the vegetables. Drip soaking is best 
if it can be organised: overhead watering in sum­
m er promotes mildew and in winter foliage can 
freeze if the watering is done late in the afternoon.

Benign Neglect
CANBERRA SOILS
The Southern Tablelands region of New South 
Wales, of which Canberra is a part, is a series of 
tablelands eroded into hills, sloping westwards.
The M urrumbidgee and its tributaries cross the 
region and drain the three large developed urban 
areas of Canberra: the Molonglo River flows 
through the city area, Woden and Weston; 
Ginninderra Creek through Belconnen; and the 
M urrumbidgee 
through 
south 
Woden 
and 
Tuggeranong.
The pattern of soils in the area is complex but, as 
a generalisation, soils are either red and yellow 
earths on the plains or lighter, loamy soils with clay 
subsoils on the hill slopes. They are shallow, par­
ticularly on the slopes, varying in depth from a few 
centimetres to a metre. T he few pockets of alluvial 
soils along the Molonglo and M urrum bidgee Riv­
ers are used either for m arket gardening or are 
shifted to develop Canberra’s public and private 
gardens.
Although some recently settled areas, formerly 
grazing areas, may have had superphosphate dres­
sings, Canberra soils, in their natural state, impose 
great limitations on plant growth. They have 
neither the chemical nor the physical structure for 
intensive vegetable gardening.
• The most common soil profile in the region, the 
sandy or loamy surface with clay subsoil, pre­
sents problems with water penetration, poor root 
growth, water-logging in wet weather and sur­
face caking in dry weather. I'he physical struc­
ture of local soils is variable but generally poor.
• Canberra soils are moderately sour. This means 
that the ratio of acidity to alkalinity (or pH level) 
is low. T he am ount of calcium, or lime, in the 
soils is not high enough to ‘unlock’ existing soil 
nutrients and make them available to growing 
plants.
• The chemical structure of local soils is relatively 
infertile. They are deficient in some of the major 
elements needed for plant growth, particularly 
phosphorus. However, potassium is rarely defic­
ient in the clay soils common to the area.
To develop a rich, deep, porous soil, dark with
humus, best suited for vegetable growing, the
Canberra gardener will have to do three things:
• alter the acidity-alkalinity level of the soil by 
adding lime or a similar calcium additive like 
dolomite
• compensate for the phosphorus deficiency with 
a phosphorus-rich fertiliser
• build up soil fertility and improve soil structure 
with organic material.
Mulch helps to improve the structure of clayey soils and 
will build up soil on thin, rocky slopes

CANBERRA CLIMATE
The temperate subhumid climate of the region has 
distinct summer and winter seasons with marked 
limits to plant growth.
Rainfall
The average rainfall for the region is 630-670 mm 
and is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year 
and the district, averaging 40-50 mm per month in 
winter and increasing to 50-60 mm per month for 
the rest of the year. October is the wettest month 
with a rainfall average of 70-78 mm.
*Growing season

Data from ‘Climate of Canberra’
Temperatures
In summer the average daily range is from 13-27°C 
with a highest recorded maximum of 42°C. In 
winter the average daily range is from 0-12°C with 
a lowest recorded minimum of -10°C. Tem pera­
tures in spring and autum n are similar, the average 
daily range for both October and March being 
from 10-23°C.

Hazards
Frost: Frosts occur about 100 days each year, 
mostly between April and October, with some 
frosts as early as March and some as late as 
November.
Drought: About thirteen severe droughts have 
been recorded in Canberra since 1827, while 
droughts of short duration are a constant 
problem.
Winds: In summer the prevailing winds are 
north-westerlies with afternoon easterly breezes. 
Cold westerly and north-westerly winds in winter 
and early spring and the hot westerlies in sum­
mer affect areas with those aspects.
Snow: Snow falls (but does not settle) in Canberra 
about every two years. Snow covers the ranges 
surrounding the area for much of winter.
10

Climatic Pattern
Severe winter depression with low temperatures 
and f rosts, the areas most severely af fected being 
those which are low lying or have a westerly 
aspect.
Summer depression with high temperatures, some­
times unreliable rainfall and frequent hot 
north-westerly and westerly winds. High evap­
oration and transpiration rates and surface 
runoff affect water retention.
Spring and autumn peaks with regular rainfall 
and warm temperatures in late spring and early 
autumn.
Frost
The gardener’s main concern about the climate is 
how long the growing season will be. This will be 
determined by the last f rosts in spring and the f irst 
frosts in autumn but microclimatic peculiarities 
reduce that period in many parts of Canberra be­
cause of temperature inversion — the f rosty hollow 
effect.
Frosty Hollows
Temperature normally decreases with altitude but 
on clear still evenings cold air drains onto the low­
est ground and remains there, reversing the usual 
pattern. Overnight minimum temperatures can be 
as much as 7°C lower in the frosty hollow than 
above it. Areas that have plenty of trees will have 
some frost protection. Treeless hill slopes can be 
affected by a frost while the well vegetated frosty 
hollow can miss the full frost effects.

SOIL FERTILITY
The key to long term soil fertility is hum us but it is 
quickly depleted in continually cultivated and 
well-watered soils. With deep mulching, hum us is 
constantly renewed with no cultivation and the 
astute gardener has time to consider using other 
soil renovating techniques to complement deep 
mulching.
Earthworms
Earthworms are a useful indicator of the success of 
your soil fertility program . The more you have the 
better the soil. By consuming an enorm ous am ount 
of organic material earthworm s return to the soil 
their casts, which improve the soil’s structure, in­
crease the availability of soil nutrients to plants and 
deeply cultivate the soil to allow better air and 
water penetration. Encourage them by feeding 
them leftover scraps from the kitchen or animal 
m anures left under the deep mulch. They thrive 
on waste ground cof fee.
Animal Manures
While animal manures are plentiful and readily 
available, gardeners will be able to replenish 
humus in the soil as well as provide considerable 
quantities of plant nutrients. The nutrient value of 
animal manures depends on the quality of the 
animal’s feed and the freshness of the manure. Pig 
m anure and chicken m anure in particular have 
high concentrations of nitrogen, potassium and 
that ingredient missing in Canberra soils, phos­
phorus. As well, the nutrients in pig and chicken 
m anure are in soluble form, essential if they are to 
be readily available to plants.
Take care not to place fresh m anure in direct 
contact with growing crops because it will burn 
them. However, if you spread chicken m anure 
thinly at a maximum rate of about 300 grams per 
square metre underneath the deep mulch then 
there will be little danger of burning seedlings.

When Canberra’s poultry farms or stables advertise
composted manure for sale, you can solve your soil 
fertility problems easily. At little expense, with 
some labour, you can provide your garden with the 
benefits of high quality m anure aged in straw, hay 
or sawdust litter.
Green Manuring
Growing a green crop which is returned to the soil 
at maturity will help to improve soil fertility. Ehe 
nutrients of the plants themselves are added to the 
soil, the organic material will help restore humus, 
the rotting roots will deeply ‘cultivate’ the soil and 
if legumes, like peas or beans, are used as the green 
m anure then the soil’s nitrogen is increased be­
cause the nitrogen fixing bacteria in these plants 
use atmospheric nitrogen for their growth.
In large holdings the techniques for green m an­
uring can be elaborate and laborious but for the 
home gardener it is easier. In Canberra you can 
grow a crop of peas or broad beans in August, take 
a first picking, knock over the plant and spread it 
under the mulch. A late January or early February 
planting of peas or French beans will give you a 
picking before the frosts affect the setting of the 
peas or beans. Scatter a handful of pea or lupin 
seeds on the soil or mulch in an area in your gar­
den which you do not want to use for some time. 
Grow them in winter when other crops are impos­
sible. Allow a couple of weeks before replanting 
the garden. If you find that the intended green 
m anure crop is prolific, abandon the idea of using 
it as green manure. After the harvest, chop the 
plants and leave them under the mulch.

Crop Rotation
C rop rotation does not seem to he common among 
organic gardeners if their literature is anything to 
go by, perhaps because their soil fertility is very 
high. But the procedure requires little planning, so 
that until your soil has reached an acceptable level 
of fertility, take advantage of its benefits.
With crop rotation, the garden can use the fertil­
ity provided by the vegetables themselves: leafy 
greens like lettuce and cabbage which require heavy 
m anuring and plenty of nitrogen follow peas and 
beans; and root crops, which dislike that environ­
ment, will follow leafy greens. Growing the same 
crops in the same ground repeatedly depletes the 
soil of the particular nutrients required by those 
crops.
Rotation, too, will reduce the possibility of 
disease organisms associated with the same plant or 
similar plants building up in the soil.

after another; swedes and turnips are brassicas, silver beet 
and beetroot are beets.
COMPOSTING
Composting increases the rate at which material 
rots. Layers of organic waste are built up in such a 
way that the micro-organisms in the heap will 
quickly multiply and the high tem peratures they 
create will destroy pathogens, parasites, pests and 
weeds. The final product should be a crumbly soil 
rich in humus and plant nutrients. Unfortunately, 
there seem to be too many methods, too many pit­
falls, too much work and never enough compost.
Compost is a useful adjunct to the deep mulch 
garden as good compost is an excellent medium 
for growing seeds and seedlings in the mulch. The 
indolent method of compost making uses up the 
organic materials that are not put directly under 
the mulch.
Methods of Making Compost
Compost is only as good as its ingredients, so Can­
berra composters should ensure that materials 
high in phosphorus are used, like blood and bone 
or rock phosphate. Materials with potassium 
include lawn clippings, poultry m anure, wood ash 
and seaweed. Nitrogenous materials are more 
readily available like leaves, lawn clippings, grasses, 
weeds, plant material, animal manures. W hatever 
materials are used, some kind of activator is 
needed to encourage the decomposing process. 
This can be m anure, blood and bone, lime or a 
brand activator.
For those gardeners who are dedicated compost 
makers, the CSIRO Division of Soils has, in its Dis­
covering Soils series, a booklet, Composting -  Making 
Soil Improver from Rubbish. The author advocates 
the Berkeley method as the best method of com­
post making. Alternate layers of high nitrogen and 
low nitrogen materials are built up to about 1.5m 
(5ft) high. The layers are dam pened, the heap 
turned, mixed and aerated after 3 or 4 days, and 
every 2 or 3 days for 2 to 3 weeks depending on 
how fine the compost is to be. The booklet is avail­
able at the Australian Government Publishing Ser­
vice bookship in Alinga Street, Canberra City.

Indore Method: The compost heap is built up in 
alternative layers of vegetable m atter with a soil 
activator or manures between them. As each layer 
goes down, water well. Continue the layers to about 
1.5m (5ft). Turn the heap after 6 weeks and 12 
weeks.
Compost Bins: The same procedure is used as the 
Indore Method except that there is no turning of 
the heap. This means that more activator materials 
must be used like manures, lime or blood and 
bone.
Compost Boxes: A more perm anent compost box 
can be made, one for the m aturing compost, which 
after 6 weeks can be transferred to the other bin 
for final maturing before starting again. Slats need 
to be spaced for adequate aeration, front slats can 
be removable.
Indolent Method: The indolent method of com­
post making involves building up a compost heap 
over a longer time, keeping in mind the need to 
add various kinds of green materials, soil, m anure 
and blood and bone. T he procedure is much more 
haphazard than the various other compost recipes 
and takes a longer time to decompose. Compost 
should be taken from the bottom of the heap as the 
top layers will still be in the process of decompos­
ing.

FERTILISERS
Of the three main fertiliser sources, chemical fer­
tilisers, organic manures and crushed ores, rocks 
or minerals, organic gardeners will depend on the 
latter two fertilisers.
Chemical fertilisers can decrease the earthworm 
population, and many organic gardeners argue 
that all chemical fertilisers will decrease it seriously. 
If soluble chemical fertilisers are over-used then 
there is an increase in the concentration of salts in 
the soil, often to the point where the plants are 
unable to take up water.
Using organic or inorganic fertilisers alone will 
not help build up soil fertility. Fertilisers should be 
used to supply nutrients missing in the soil or not 
available to the plants. Over-use of any fertiliser 
can reduce plant growth by creating deficiencies — 
too much nitrogen can cause potassium deficiency, 
too much phosphorus can cause potassium and 
zinc deficiency and too much potassium will cause 
magnesium deficiency.
Lime
Lime, the common name for calcium carbonate, is 
not usually regarded as a fertiliser but if it is used 
to reduce the acidity of C anberra’s soil then it has 
the effect of making some of the existing soil nut­
rients more easily available to growing plants. With 
the use of lime the pH level of the soil can be in­
creased to 6.5-6.8 which is ideal for encouraging 
helpful flora and fauna including earthworms.
Nutrient Availability at Various pH Ranges
A useful form of lime for domestic gardens 
is dolomite, magnesium-calcium carbonate. It sup­
plies magnesium as well as calcium to the soil and 
can be mixed with animal m anures and nitrogen­
ous fertilisers provided it is immediately covered 
with mulch to reduce the loss of ammonia to the 
atmosphere.
Caution in the use of lime is im portant because 
over-liming can produce deficiencies in essential 
elements like iron and manganese.
Some vegetables are tolerant to soil acidity:

Blood and Bone
Blood and bone is a slow acting organic fertiliser 
ideal for Canberra soils. It is rich in phosphorus, 
moderately rich in nitrogen with smaller am ounts 
of 
potassium, 
zinc 
and 
manganese. 
It 
will 
adequately supply the nitrogen needs of leafy 
vegetables and the phosphorus needs of legumes 
as well as compensating for the phosphorus defi­
ciency in local soils.
Use it at a rate of 100 grams, or 3 handfuls, per 
square metre for establishing a garden, and half 
that rate every two years as a maintenance dose.

If you are wondering whether your Canberra 
garden needs lime, a good indicator is sorrel. If it is 
growing happily then your soil needs lime If so, 
take advantage of it by planting potatoes which 
have a preference for acid soils. You can add lime 
for the next crop.
If you are preparing new vegetable gardens, 
dolomite should be applied under the mulch at the 
rate of about 500 grams, or 10 handfuls, per 
square metre. After this initial heavy dressing, lime 
can be added at a quarter of that rate every two
years or so.
If you want to loosen heavy clay soils, apply lime 
with plenty of organic material.
Foliar Fertilisers
Plants can absorb nutrients through their leaves as 
well as their roots. An increasing num ber of 
organic foliar fertilisers are on the m arket includ­
ing many based on seaweed, which has appreciable 
quantities of essential trace elements, some of 
which may be lacking in your soil. Seaweed fertilis­
ers are, indeed, a complete fertiliser, for the major 
elements needed for plant growth are there too. 
T he level of nitrogen in the seaweed form ula is 
often increased by adding urea.
Seaweed fertilisers are the safe way to treat any 
suspected mineral shortage, and mineral short- 
age-linked diseases, so use them regularly until you 
think your soil has reached an acceptable level of 
fertility.
Young leaves can absorb most of the nutrients 
within 24 hours particularly if the fertiliser is 
applied when the humidity is relatively high, either 
in the morning or in the late afternoon. What is not 
absorbed by the leaves will be absorbed by the roots 
of the plant.

PESTS AND DISEASES
C anberra has a num ber of advantages over 
warm er, maritime climates for pest and disease 
control: severe winters reduce insect populations, 
insect damage and insect-borne diseases and long 
dry summers reduce the problems of mildew 
which can seriously affect vegetables in the coastal 
regions. Moreover many areas of Canberra are 
only recently suburban so the gardens should be 
disease and pest free for some time.
Remember that pests and diseases do not strike 
haphazardly nor do they generally strike together. 
Seasonal factors, particularly if extreme, and m an­
agem ent procedures affect the flora and fauna 
lurking in the shrubbery. Work on the principle 
that pests and diseases are indicators of poor soil 
fertility, that the poorer the soil the greater the pest 
and disease problem.
Management
Preventative measures are the better part of 
rational pest and disease control.
Use disease-resistant seeds and seedlings from 
reliable nurseries. Seed packets will often tell you if 
the seeds are resistant to particular diseases. Diver­
sify your crops by growing different varieties; in 
some seasons one variety will flourish while the 
others languish and there is nothing you can do 
about it except plant different crops.
Unwanted plants, or weeds, can be kept away 
from the garden by mulching. Keep weeds under 
control in out of the way places because some bugs, 
like the green vegetable bug, can winter over on 
them before multiplying in spring and moving to 
your vegetables.
Rotate crops to control diseases in the soil and 
reduce the chance of insect infestation from the old 
crop. Tomatoes, potatoes, aubergines and cap­
sicums are all susceptible to similar diseases so avoid 
planting them one after another on the same patch 
of ground.
Build up soil fertility, watch the watering pro­
gram and fertilise your plants. Strong and healthy 
plants have natural defence mechanisms to with­
stand pests and diseases.
If plants are seriously diseased, rather than insect 
infested, pull them out.
Grow enough for the bugs. Pests and disease will 
appear in the best m anaged gardens so take precau­
tions by planting enough for the family and a little 
more for potential rivals.
Companion planting is believed by some to im­
prove plant growth by association with other ‘sym­
pathetic’ plants as well as by conferring resistance to 
disease and pest attack. Apart from the chemical 
inhibitions mentioned above, experimental proof 
of good and bad vegetable associations is hard to 
come by. But when in doubt, keep an open mind!
Grow inhibitory plants am ong your vegetables. 
Garlic, marigolds and chrysanthemums have effec­
tive chemicals in their roots that repel nematodes, 
minute worms which attack plant roots. Basil re­
duces nematodes in the tomato patch, and sage and 
mint are reputed to repel the cabbage butterfly.

COMPANION PLANTS
Perhaps the real benefit of companion planting is 
diversifying what is growing in the vegetable garden 
and reducing the pest hazard and disease transmis­
sion problems that monoculture can bring. Our 
own fairly extensive experience has been inconclu­
sive but we still consider the plant’s affinities when 
planting, partly out of faith, but mostly out of a 
belief that the greater the variety in plantings, the 
less likelihood of insect infestation.

POISONS FOR THE GARDEN
If after trying all this, you find the pests and dis­
eases are still there, perhaps the cause has been a 
long wet spring and you have mildew, or a long hot 
sum m er with startling numbers of green vegetable 
bugs. In cases like these we treat the symptoms.
Indiscriminate chemical warfare is not the 
answer. T here are no ‘safe’ insecticides. The ‘safest’ 
are the least immediately effective but they still kill 
and they too can affect the good bugs as well as the 
bad.
Each gardener has to decide what the balance is 
to be between good plant growth and poisons. If 
the gardener avoids using some of the more potent 
poisons on the m arket like DDT, chlordane, diel- 
drin or lindane, reduced harvests may be the only 
price, and it is not a high price to pay for protec­
tion from the long term damage they do. Use in­
secticides derived from plants. They are effective 
for the backyard gardener, but, unfortunately, 
too expensive and unreliable for the commercial 
gardener.

Now try this
Now that you have been convinced that it is pos­
sible to have a low-labour garden with an inbuilt 
soil replenishment process, convert your existing 
vegetable gardens or start from the beginning.
Converting Your Garden to a Deep Mulch Garden
Before you begin, consider the general acidity and 
fertility levels of the existing garden. It they have 
been limed and fertilised in the past, then the 
simplest way to create a deep mulch garden is to 
build up the mulch with layers of spoilt straw or 
hay to a depth of 150-200cm (6-8in). If there are 
weeds in the garden, make the mulch a little 
thicker. If you want to use up some of your news­
paper, put 3 or 4 layers under the mulch.
You will need to use fertilisers to ensure good 
plant growth when you plant your seeds and seed­
lings.
O r . . .
If you are dubious about the acidity and fertility 
levels of the garden beds, then add dolomite lime 
and a fertiliser before adding the layers of news­
paper and mulch.
dolomite — 5 handfuls per square metre 
blood and bone — 2 handfuls per square m etre 
animal m anure — 10cm ((/‘»in) layer
Starting from Scratch
You can make a deep mulch garden on virtually 
any surface. This procedure is suitable for convert­
ing a lawn area to a deep mulch.
Lime the area at the rate of 500 grams per 
square metre — 10 handfuls per square metre. 
Fertilise the area at the rate of 3 handfuls per
square metre, with blood and bone or a thick layer 
(25mm or lin) of animal manure.
Cover with thick layers of newspapers so that 
there is a complete light-excluding barrier over the 
grass or weeds.
Build up the mulch with the spoiled straw or hay 
to a depth of 15-20cm (6-8in).
With both these methods you can put your 
kitchen and garden wastes directly under the deep 
mulch.
One bale of spoiled hay or straw should 
adequately cover 3 square metres (18 square feet) 
approximately.
Urban Sheet Mulching
Permaculture is the exciting concept of Bill Molli- 
son and David Holmgren. T heir book, Permacul­
ture One, is a resource book for a low energy, high 
yielding agriculture ecosystem of animal species 
and perennial plants useful to man. Perm aculture 
is a design for future urban and rural develop­
ments integrating aspects of many disciplines like 
ecology, landscape design, energy conservation, 
architecture and agriculture. The Canberra Per­
maculture Society actively seeks ways to adapt the 
design to Canberra.
In terms of the domestic vegetable garden in 
Canberra there can be little application of the 
grand perm aculture design but urban sheet mulch­
ing, as Mollison and Holmgren describe it, is one of 
the 
variations of a 
deep 
mulch 
gardening 
technique.
The procedure is:
Scatter organic nitrogen (like poultry m anure or 
blood and bone) and some ground limestone or 
dolomite on the area to be planted. Leave grasses 
and weeds untouched.
‘Tile’ the area with a thick organic, light- 
excluding barrier using materials like cloths, car­
pets, newspaper or cardboard. Use leaves, sawdust, 
bark or straw as a loose cover over the ‘tiled’ area.
Use buckets of sandy soil to make small mounds 
for planting seeds and seedlings. W ater well.

Vegetable calendar
The calendar is a guide to planting seeds and seed­
lings for optimum seasonal conditions, disease re­
sistance, maximum growth and yields. However, 
seeds and seedlings have a considerable ability to 
compensate for unfavourable conditions. A re­
duced or delayed harvest may be the only signific­
ant result of idiosyncratic plantings.
The part-time gardener can save time and effort 
by buying seedlings from nurseries. While seed­
lings are convenient and available at appropriate 
times for planting they are not always available 
when planning for particular harvests. To plan for 
a winter garden of, say, silver beet, lettuce, brussels 
sprouts and herbs, seeds and seedlings must he 
available in December, January or February.
This calendar recommends later plantings, usu­
ally by a month, than is usual for a Canberra grow­
ing calendar. This allows greater chances for frost 
to be over and the ground to have warmed up. 
However, when the calendar recommends October 
as a planting time, late September is appropriate 
too. Summer crops, some Canberra gardeners say, 
should be in on the long weekend in early October.

A VEGETABLE ‘EFFICIENCY’ LIST
For the part-time gardener, growing exotic vege­
tables is interesting but incidental to producing a 
good harvest from a small area with little labour.
For the gardener conscious of food value, each 
season should include root crops and leafy green 
crops. This list is an ‘efficiency’ list: generous har­
vests from small areas over a reasonable time, with 
short or medium growing periods.

Now go ahead
I he usual way to eat artichokes is to pull off the 
leaves, dip them if hot in melted butter and lemon 
juice, or if cold, in mayonnaise or vinaigrette. Very 
young artichokes are delicious sliced raw in salads.
ARTICHOKES 
Globe Artichokes
Cynara cordunculus var. scolymus
Plant seeds of the Purple Globe or Green Globe 
variety, or better still, plant suckers if you can get 
them, in July or August. Have 3 or 4 plants, more 
if you and your family are addicted. After the 
plants yellow in autum n, build up the mulch.
Globe artichokes are attractive and very orna­
mental plants that do well in Canberra, growing up 
to 1.5 metres (5ft) in sunny positions. Deep mulch­
ing techniques are ideal, for they like rich soil and 
plenty of moisture during the growing season.
The buds are the delicacy. If you want to grow 
large ones, thin the suckers when the new growth 
appears in spring to about 4 suckers per plant and 
as the bush spreads nip the lateral buds. In a 
minimum labour garden don’t bother; small buds 
are delicious and can be eaten raw or fried whole in 
butter or oil.
Harvest the buds while they are still tight and 
tender. If the buds are m ature like the ones you 
see in the greengrocers, cut off the outer leaf-like 
sepals and trim their tops. Spread the ‘leaves’ a 
little and boil them in salted water with lemon juice 
or vinegar to keep their colour, for 15 to 30 mi­
nutes, depending on size.
Venetian Artichokes
Cut the outer ‘leaves’ away from 6 to 8 arti­
chokes and stew them gently with the lid on for 
an hour in 2 tablespoons each of oil, white wine 
and water. l est them by pricking the base which 
should then be soft. l ake off the lid and reduce 
the sauce to oil before serving.
Greek Artichokes
6 young artichokes 
2 tablespoons oil 
1 clove garlic 
lemon juice 
1 onion, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
2 tablespoons parsley, 
chopped
1 cup stock or water and 
wine
Prepare the artichokes as before and put them 
with all the other ingredients in a pan. Stew 
gently until tender, about 30 minutes. Remove 
the artichokes, puree or mash the remaining 
vegetables and reduce them if necessary to a 
sauce. Serve the artichokes with the sauce 
poured over them.
(A very simple version of a traditional dish.)

Jerusalem Artichokes
Helianthus tuberosum
In spring plant 1 or 2 tubers from a friend’s garden 
under the mulch in a perm anent spot. Harvest the 
tubers in autumn and winter as needed, and mulch 
the area. They do well anywhere but beware, they 
can become a nuisance.
An ideal vegetable for the labour-free garden if 
you and your family are not allergic to them. 
Jerusalem artichokes are a perennial plant. The 
edible part is the nobbly tuber which has a nutty 
flavour, and a texture like water chestnuts.
Scrub the tubers. Boil them for 15-20 minutes 
and then scrape off the skin. They are now 
ready to be used in other recipes or eaten, but be 
warned that some people react to Jerusalem  
Artichokes with an awful case of flatulence. 
Artichoke soup seems to reduce the problem. They 
can be used raw in salads and oriental cooking as 
water chestnuts.
Artichoke with Tomatoes
1 kilo small artichokes basil or marjoram 
4-5 tomatoes, skinned 
garlic 
and chopped 
olive oil
Cook the peeled artichokes whole until they are 
almost cooked. Drain them and cut each in half, 
then put them into a little olive oil heated in a 
pan. Add the tomatoes with some basil or m ar­
joram  and a crushed clove of garlic. The arti­
chokes should be ready when the tomatoes have 
softened and become a sauce. They can be eaten 
as a single dish or as an accompaniment to meat.
Artichokes stewed in Wine
Vi kg artichokes, 
1 glass wine or cider
peeled 
garlic
1 onion, sliced 
nutmeg
1 tablespoon flour 
parsley
Cook the onion gently in oil tnen add the flour 
and stir for a minute. When it has been 
absorbed, add a glass of wine or cider, bring it to 
the boil and then add the artichokes with a 
crushed clove of garlic and a pinch of nutmeg. 
Simmer gently until the artichokes are cookea. 
Serve with chopped parsley on top.
Artichoke Soup
(Put scrubbed artichokes into water with lemon 
juice to prevent discolouration.)
10-12 artichokes 
1 cup cream
2 onions, chopped 
parsley
butter for frying 
parmesan cheese,
5 cups stock 
grated
Melt the butter in a large saucepan and gently 
fry the onions. Slice the scrubbed^ artichokes one 
by one and fry them with the onions. Keep the 
heat low, put the lid on so they ‘sweat’ rather 
than fry and they will not discolour. Simmer for 
5 minutes, add stock, bring to the boil and sim­
mer for a further 15 minutes. Puree the soup, 
return it to the saucepan, add the cream and 
parsley, and serve with parmesan cheese.

ASPARAGUS
Asparagus officinalis
Plant root-crowns, spreading the roots carefully, 
when they are one or two years old, preferably the 
Mary Washington variety, about 16-20 plants for a 
family of four. Prepare the garden in July or June 
if necessary and plant in July or August. Each plant 
needs about .2 square metres (2 square feet). Build 
up the mulch over them.
Asparagus does well in Canberra but it needs lots 
of space and plenty of time. It is not a high priority 
vegetable for the gardener with limited space, as 
the return on the space occupied is low. It is a 
perennial and takes about 3 years before the shoots 
are fully mature. Once the asparagus is established 
it will produce for years, but even then the harvest 
can be variable in the numbers harvested and the 
thickness.
You can harvest lightly and infrequently during 
the second year, and during the third year harvest 
until the spears look thin. Allow the plants to fern 
in late sum m er and cut back to ground level when 
the frosts start. Build up the mulch.
The green spears are superior to the white 
spears in flavour and nutrition so allow them to 
darken a little through the mulch before cutting 
them at the base. Asparagus deteriorates quickly so 
get it to the pot within a couple of hours.
Cooking can be a problem because overcooked 
asparagus is watery and tasteless. If the spears are 
tough (or ones you have bought at the green­
grocers) peel off the scales at the base of the stalk 
with a potato peeler.
To cook
Tie the spears in bundles and boil them with 
their heads above water for 12-15 minutes 
depending on the size of the spears.
Cut off an inch or so of stalk and lay them on the 
bottom of the pan. Put the rest of the spears on 
top, add water or stock, bring to the noil and 
cook for 8-10 minutes.
If you have only a few spears, put them on top ol 
rice, cooking by the absorption method. Wnen 
the rice is cooked serve the spears. l est by pierc­
ing the base of the asparagus; if it is soft, it is 
ready.
Freshly-harvested asparagus is too delicious to 
be served elaborately anci the gluttons won’t let 
you.
Serve with butter, parsley butter, or butter that 
has been heated to a light hazelnut colour.
Asparagus Omelette
Cook thin spears as above and wrap the tips in an 
omelette prepared in the usual way.

AUBERGINE (EGGPLANT)
Solanum melangena esculentum
Transplant available seedlings or plant early 
m aturing varieties like Early Long Purple or Sup­
reme in October and November, well after the 
frosts. Interplant aubergines with their relatives, 
tomatoes, if you wish, for they like similar growing 
conditions.
Moussaka
6 medium aubergines, 6 tablespoons toasted 
sliced lengthwise and 
crumos 
salted 
Vt cup olive oil
1 tablespoon butter 
1 Vi cups white sauce
Vi kilo minced meat 
(becnamel)
2 onions, chopped 
2 tablespoons grated
2 tablespoons tomato 
cheese
puree and little water Vi cup wine 
Melt butter, add onions and meat and fry till 
brown. Stir in the wine, tomato puree and water, 
season, cover and cook gently for 30 mintues. 
Remove from heat and add 4 tablespoons of the 
breadcrumbs. Heat olive oil and fry aubergine 
slices. Grease a large dish, sprinkle with bread­
crumbs. Arrange a layer of aubergines then the 
meat. Continue in layers until aubergines and 
meat are finished. Cover with bechamel sauce. 
Sprinkle with cheese and breadcrumbs. Bake in 
the oven till golden brown.
Aubergines are a gift of a late Canberra summer 
for they need those four or five months of warm 
weather. They are a beautiful grey-green bush 
with handsome purple fruit, the brinjal of India, 
the ‘poor man’s meat’ of the Middle East. Plant 
them for their beauty and if your palate is unim ­
pressed, give the fruit to an appreciative friend.
Aubergines ripen one at a time. Pick them when 
they are firm, dark and glossy. They are a surpris­
ingly versatile vegetable. Middle Eastern and 
Indian recipes have them pureed, pickled, stuffed 
and baked, deep fried and sauteed; while western 
European recipes for the distinctive aubergine are 
the Greek moussaka, the Turkish Imam Bayeldi 
and the Provencale ratatouille. A magnificent 
farewell to summer.
To prepare aubergines for cooking, sprinkle salt 
on the slices or cubes and leave them for 20-30 
minutes. This will reduce the am ount of oil they 
absorb, the bitterness and toughness that cooked 
aubergines can develop. Some recipes don’t need 
it.
Imam Bayeldi
5 aubergines
6 onions, sliced
6 tomatoes, chopped 
and peeled
2-3 cloves garlic, 
chopped 
1 cup olive oil 
parsley
Cut aubergines in half lengthwise, scoop out 
their centre, sprinkle with salt, squeeze dry. Fry 
onions, garlic and tomatoes in 2 tablespoons oil, 
season. Put stuffing into aubergines, arrange 
them in pan. Pour rest of oil and some water into 
pan. Bake in moderate oven for an hour. Serve 
cold.
Ratatouille
3 medium onions, 
sliced
2 large aubergines, 
cubed and salted
3 zucchini, cubed and 
salted
3 large red peppers, 
seeded and sliced 
Heat olive oil in a large, flat pan. Add the 
onions, soften them and add garlic, peppers, 
the drained aubergine, and zucchini. Cover the 
pan and cook very gently for 30 minutes. Add 
tomatoes and cook till vegetables are soft but not 
soupy.
4 large tomatoes, 
skinned 
2 garlic cloves, 
chopped
2 small cups olive oil

BEANS
French and Climbing Beans
Phaseolus vulgaris
Grow dwarf and climbing varieties after the 
frosts have finished as beans are frost sensitive. 
Choose varieties that are stringless if you want to 
reduce preparation time in the kitchen. Climbing 
beans bear later than dwarf beans, so plant them at 
the same time. In Canberra they do well in spring 
and autum n, for some varieties are as sensitive to 
very hot weather as they are to very cold weather. 
Beans do very well in deep mulch because they like 
constant moisture during flowering for good pod 
setting.
For the novice and experienced gardener alike, 
homegrown beans are a continuing pleasure, dis­
ease and pest problems are virtually non-existent, 
they have a short growing season and a long har­
vest and they are a delicious vegetable raw or 
cooked.
Sometimes called the French bean, the common 
bean has bush and climbing varieties. Bush beans 
have several varieties — dwarf, stringless or runner 
and yellow butter varieties as well as shell beans 
which are grown for the bean not the pod.
Choose varieties to suit your style, family needs 
and taste. You can’t go wrong.
French Beans. French beans are very easy to m an­
age in the deep mulch garden. Clear the mulch, 
plant your seeds after the frosts, perhaps a bush 
stringless variety like Tendergreen, and once the 
bushes are established, return the mulch. The 
mulch will serve as a support for the beans when 
they begin to crop heavily so there will be no need 
for staking.
Fry other bush varieties too, like W indsor 
Longpod or Brown Beauty which will pod in very
hot weather. If they are picked young enough, the 
strings are not a problem, and they are more 
adaptable to a variable growing season than the 
stringless varieties.
If you have the space, try shell beans like Red 
Kidney or Cannellini. Leave the pods until the 
seeds are large and m ature, and use them as a 
vegetable or dry and store them for later use.
Harvest young beans regularly to encourage new 
crops.
Climbing Beans. Scarlet Runner {Phaseolus multif- 
lorus) and Giant of Stuttgart are both prolific var­
ieties of climber beans. They are sensitive to very 
hot weather so some shade or protection will allow 
them to set in summer. If you crop them regularly, 
you can expect harvest for a couple of months or 
more if conditions are good.
Don’t remove the roots when the Scarlet Runner 
crop is finished, they will set new roots for the next 
season. After a few years you may want to get new 
stock but these climber beans have at least three 
years of regrowth. They are an excellent vegetable 
for the low-labour garden.
Bean Sprouts.
Soak the beans in tepid water in a ja r with a lid 
for about 12 hours. Rinse and drain the seeds 
thoroughly twice a day for 3-6 days. Use the lid as a 
drainer. In winter they need some warmth, about 
21°C. Leave the sprouts in the light if you want 
them to be green; leave them in the dark if you 
want them to be white. The sprouts will be ready 
when they are an inch long and plump.
Bean sprouts will solve part of your vegetable 
problem during that quiet time between winter 
and spring. They are easy to grow, delicious and a 
valuable food with high protein and vitamin con­
tent.
33

--- Page 42 ---
The sprouts are ready in 3-6 days depending on 
the season; they don’t need soil or sunlight, can be 
grown indoors any time and are very nutritious.
Prepare mung beans for cooking by stirring 
them in a dish of cold water so that the green shells 
will float away. Do not overcook them, they should 
remain crisp and firm. Most sprouts will stay fresh 
in the refrigerator for 4-7 days.
Serve beans and bean sprouts raw in salads and 
tem pt the children with them. Do not overcook 
beans, particularly bush beans, cook them whole 
for 8-10 minutes in boiling water. If they are crisp 
and firm so much the better for taste and nutrition. 
Climber beans should not be cut up for cooking as 
they lose some of their flavour. They need 10-12 
minutes of cooking and if you prefer to eat the 
beans inside rather than the pods, cook the whole 
pod before removing the bean.
Noodle and Bean Sprout
4 cups chicken stock 
shredded cooked 
2 handfuls fine egg 
chicken
noodles 
6 tablespoons bean
2 teaspoons cornflour 
sprouts
parsley, coriander 
garnish
Boil the noodles in stock for 2 minutes and then 
remove them. Mix the cornflour with 3 table­
spoons of cold water and pour it into the soup. 
Cook until soup is clear. Stir in the chicken, 
sprouts and noodles. Serve with parsley or 
coriander garnish.
Bean Sprout Omelette
4 eggs 
1 tablespoon chopped
2 teaspoons light soya 
parsley
sauce 
3 tablespoons vegetable
6 tablespoons bean 
oil
sprouts
Beat the eggs with 1 teaspoon soya sauce and 1 
tablespoon water. Heat 2 tablespoons oil. Pour in 
the egg mixture to make a thin pancake omelette. 
When cool, cut it into strips. Heat the remaining 
oil and stir fry the sprouts for 3 minutes. Add the 
remaining soya sauce, egg strips and parsley. Stir 
fry for 1 minute more. Serve.
Beans With Soy Dressing
Cooked beans served cold in salads are delicious 
and they do not lose flavour and texture, 
plate of cooked beans 
1 Vi tablespoons vinegar 
5 tablespoons crunchy 2 tablespoons soy sauce 
peanut butter
Beat the peanut butter, vinegar and soy sauce in a 
cup with a fork till creamy. Pour over beans. Serve 
cold.
Beans With Garlic And Basil
Cook some French beans to taste. Heat 2 table­
spoons olive oil, crush a clove of garlic into it with 
some chopped basil and pour this over the beans. 
Serve hot.

BROAD BEANS
Vicia faba
Sow Early Long Pod, Coles Dwarf Prolific or any 
of the Windsor varieties in late winter, late July or 
August, remembering that germination will be slow 
in the depths of winter.
You can if you wish, plant them in autum n so that 
they are well established by the coldest months 
when they will remain dorm ant until the warm 
weather. Early plantings are more prone to disease 
and aphid attacks and the flowers and pod set will be 
affected by frosty weather. The advantages of early 
plantings are offset too by the later plantings m atur­
ing not long after the early plantings. Make your 
own choice.
Broad beans are a hardy, easy to grow vegetable, 
suitable for the mulch garden. The mulch will pro­
vide some support for the tall-growing varieties. 
Grow the beans close together, about 15cm (6in) 
apart, they will be able to support one another as 
they mature.
Black aphids are fond of the growing tips of 
broad beans: use derris dust when the plant is 
young and if the bush is setting pods, nip out the 
affected tips.
N.B. pinch out the growing tips of the plants to force 
growth in the pods.
Broad beans are one of the first Canberra spring 
crops and the young firm seeds are favourites with 
children and adults for weeks during their harvest. 
If f amily tastes don’t run to vast quantities of broad 
beans, then use the crop as a green m anure.
The beans can be used like French beans when 
the pod is immature but the seeds are cooked alone 
when the pod is m ature, thick and soft. Use them 
cooked as a salad; they are delicious served cold in 
oil and vinegar dressing with slices of hard boiled
eggs-
Broad Beans with Bacon
(Simple and delicious, use ham or salami as 
variations.)
2 slices bacon, diced 
!4 cup stock/water 
1 onion, chopped 
4 cups shelled broad
some butter 
beans
Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan. Add the 
bacon and onion and fry until the onion is soft but 
not coloured. Stir in the beans. Add the stock or 
water, and bring to the boil. Cook till beans are 
soft. Evaporate excess liquid by brisk boiling. Sea­
son and serve.

BEETROOT
Beta vulgaris
Sow beetroot, either the globe or the long-rooted 
kinds, f rom September to January; too early plant­
ings will run to seed. If the last sowings are in Feb­
ruary or early March, the m ature beetroot can re­
main in the ground through the coldest months for 
a winter supply. If the very late harvests are a little 
woody, use them for soup.
Beetroot is an easy vegetable to grow and it does 
well in a wide range of soils and climatic conditions 
even though it pref ers cool to warm conditions and 
neutral soils.
In the deep mulch garden you can either clear the 
mulch completely or sow the seed in handfuls of 
compost or soil on top of the mulch. Either way, 
soak the seeds in a diluted seaweed fertiliser for a 
couple of hours before planting.
Beetroot is not usually attacked by pests or 
diseases but it is susceptible to boron deficiency 
which is likely if the soils are over-limed, as too 
much lime will prevent boron in the ground 
becoming available to the plant. If young beetroot 
leaves are thick, distorted, stunted or redder than 
usual, or the root is spotted with black, corky areas 
then use a complete fertiliser, like a seaweed fer­
tiliser, containing boron.
To prepare beetroot for the pot, cut off the tops 
about 5cm (2in) from the beet. Wash them care­
fully and avoid breaking the skin otherwise they 
will ‘bleed’ profusely while cooking. Boil them in 
plenty of salted water (adding a tablespoon of 
sugar and a couple of tablespoons of vinegar if you 
wish) from 30 minutes to an hour or so according 
to size. Test them by piercing them, when they 
should be tender right through, or by pressing the 
skin of the beetroot which will slip off easily if 
cooked. Drain them and slip off the skin, small 
roots and the stub of stalk. They are now ready to 
use, either as a hot vegetable or cold as pickled 
beetroot for salads.

BRASSICAS
Your vegetable garden is sure to have some 
members of the brassica family — broccoli, brussels 
sprouts, cauliflower, Chinese cabbage, many herbs 
including mustard, kohl rabi, kale, white turnips 
and swedes. For the indolent gardener, however, 
decisions about which of the brassicas to grow can 
be difficult because nearly all brassicas need con­
stant attention and care to get good harvests.
More than any other family of vegetables, bras­
sicas have limited conditions for very good growth: 
the soil has to be well-manured and limed, they are 
sensitive to certain soil deficiencies like molyb­
denum  and boron, and the cabbage butterfly and 
moth as well as snails and aphis are ready and wil­
ling to share the plants.
Avoid some of the more troublesome aspects of 
growing these im portant winter vegetables by 
planting broccoli and brussels sprouts, both of 
which will produce a good harvest over a long 
period provided growing conditions are good. 
Leave growing superb specimens of cauliflowers 
and cabbages to the experts, and buy them at the 
markets.
Pests and Diseases
Coping with snails and slugs is relatively easy 
with brassicas, but the cabbage butterfly and moth 
are tiresome in the extreme, particularly in late 
sum m er and early autum n. Later plantings are not 
nearly as badly affected. You can keep an old ten­
nis racquet handy for some satisfying and constitu­
tional confrontations with a few butterflies, you 
can pick off the green caterpillars, or you can use 
derris dust regularly when times are bad.
Grey aphis can be washed off with a strong jet of 
water but if the infestation is severe, particularly on 
brussels sprouts, use derris or pyrethrum , taking 
care to thoroughly cover the af fected areas.
Soil Deficiencies
Brassicas, and cauliflowers in particular, are very 
sensitive to certain deficiencies in soils.
Molybdenum deficiency causes ‘whiptaif in
cauliflowers, a yellowing in the leaves, a breakdown 
of the leaf edges, and poor development of the 
curd. If the soil has been well limed, this def iciency 
is unlikely to occur.
Boron deficiency causes curled and distorted 
leaves, browning of the curds, and hollow brown 
stems. Over-liming aggravates the problem. Spray­
ing the leaves with a solution containing 42 grams 
of borax to 19 litres of water will solve the im­
mediate problem.
Preventive measures are the most satisfactory. 
Use a complete fertiliser like a seaweed fertiliser 
with trace elements to overcome these def iciencies.

BROCCOLI
Brassica oleracea italica
Clear the mulch from an area you know to have 
good soil, transplant strong, large seedlings about 
25cm (lOin) away from each other as they need 
room to spread. For a late spring harvest, sow or 
transplant in August or September. For autum n 
and winter harvest, sow seeds in December and 
January, or transplant from January to March.
Broccoli with Cheese Sauce
lkg (21b) cooked 
1 cup milk
broccoli in 
1 cup parmesan
ovenproof dish 
cheese, grated
1 tablespoons butter 
sprinkle, of nutm eg
2 tablespoons flour
Make a sauce by melting the butter then adding 
the flour and cooking for a few minutes. Ada 
milk and seasoning, bring to boil. Cook for a few 
minutes. Add most of the cheese. Pour over 
broccoli, sprinkle with rest of cheese and bake in 
hot oven until brown.
Pure cd broccoli
Creen sprouting broccoli has fewer cultivation 
problems than other brassicas and greater toler­
ance to growing conditions that are not optimal. 
Broccoli will produce one main head and after that 
is cut, there will be a succession of smaller heads 
from other stems. If your plants are strong and 
healthy, leave them to produce another harvest in 
spring or autumn. Some plants will produce for 
years.

Preparation. Leave some stem on the broccoli 
when you harvest it. Wash carefully and peel the 
broccoli stems so that they will cook at the same 
rate as the broccoli heads. Boil for 8-10 m inutes 
and do not overcook. Serve with butter and lemon 
juice. A delicious and nutritious vegetable.

BRUSSELS SPROUTS
Brassica oleracea var. bullata gemmifera
Clear an area of mulch, sow seeds in December 
or January, or transplant strong and vigorous 
seedlings in January and February. Return the 
mulch thickly when the sprouts are established 
because they may need the support the mulch 
gives. Do not over-fertilise, rely on your soil fer­
tility for good growth.
Grey aphis are a problem so keep watch that they 
do not get out of hand.
Brussels Sprouts with Cheese
Vi kg (lib) cooked 
4 tablespoons
brussels sprouts 
2 tablespoons butter 
2 tablespoons olive 
oil
Heat the butter and olive oil till hot. Stir in the 
sprouts and as they fry, add breadcrumbs and 
cheese. Cook till breadcrumbs and cheese 
become firm. Serve.
breaacrumbs 
4 tablespoons grated 
Parmesan
Brussels Sprouts Puree
V2kg (lib) brussels 
Vi cup cream
sprouts, cooked, 
2 tablespoons butter
pureed or mashed 
salt, pepper, nutmeg 
4 potatoes, cooked 
and mashed
Blend the sprouts and cream together. Add the 
potato and butter. Beat till light and fluffy. 
Reheat and serve.
Brussels sprouts take some time to mature but they 
are well worth waiting for. The small, tight, 
cabbage-like sprouts have a distinctive and delici­
ous flavour, and even if the sprouts are not perfect, 
they will be superior in taste to the vegetable mar­
ket offerings. An ideal vegetable for the part-time 
gardener, brussels sprouts will crop continuously 
over a long period of time.
Harvest the buds from the bottom when they are 
small and firm. Cut the base of the sprout so that it 
will cook at the same rate as the head. Boil the 
sprouts for 8-10 minutes and do not overcook. 
Serve with butter and pepper, or toss in buttered 
breadcrumbs with some grated cheese.

CABBAGE
Brassica oleracea capitata
Plant seeds or seedlings from August through to 
January in areas cleared of mulch or in handfuls of 
soil on top of the mulch. Return mulch when 
plants are well established. Plant them to m ature in 
the cooler months, autum n, winter and spring. 
Watch for the cabbage butterfly and moths.
Cabbage and Bacon
lA cabbage, shredded 
1 onion, finely chopped 
4 rashers bacon, 
cloves and bay leaf
chopped 
4 tablespoons butter
Wilt the cabbage by pouring boiling water over it 
and leave for five minutes. Fry the onion and 
bacon in the butter, add the drained cabbage, 
cloves and bayleaf and cook for about 15 
minutes. Remove cloves and bay leaf. Serve.
Coleslaw
Shred some cabbage and soak in iced water for 
an hour. Drain. Mix in other shredded raw vege­
tables with herbs to taste. Serve with mayonnaise 
or oil and vinegar dressing. Add some caraway 
seeds if you like them.
Cabbages are not too difficult to grow provided 
they are well fertilised and insect pests are con­
trolled. Freshly harvested, their nutritional value is 
argum ent enough against the problems of cultiva­
tion. Choose types that will grow quickly, be adapt­
able to seasonal variations, will keep reasonably 
well in the ground after m aturing, and are good 
cooked or raw.
If you rely on seedlings from  nurseries you will 
not have as wide a varietal choice as if you grow 
them from seed you select. Most nurseries rely on 
the increasingly popular, smaller, quicker-growing 
cabbages.
Cabbage can be eaten raw or cooked. With very 
little ef fort, plain cooked cabbage can be delicious, 
nothing like the smelly, over-cooked mush that 
seemed to haunt childhood winter dinners.
Melt a little butter in a saucepan, add washed 
and shredded cabbage, a little vinegar, a small glass 
of water or wine, and gently melt the cabbage for 
about 8-10 minutes. Add caraway seeds to reduce 
the smell of cabbage cooking. They will give an 
interesting crunchiness to the final dish.

CHINESE CABBAGE
Brassica pekinensis, Brassica chinensis
Sow seeds in September and October, or 
December and January in handfuls of soil in the 
mulch or in areas cleared of mulch. Return mulch 
after transplanting strong, large seedlings. Watch 
for snails and slugs.
T here are two types of Chinese ‘cabbage’ to grow, 
both of which prefer to m ature in cool weather; 
however, it is possible to get an early sum m er har­
vest from spring plantings.
Brassica pekinensis looks like a large, oval lettuce.
Brassica chinensis, often described as Chinese 
mustard, looks like silver beet with smooth green 
leaves and white stems.
Either cabbage may be eaten cooked or raw.
Stir-fried Cabbage
lA cabbage 
2 tablespoons
vegetable oil
Wash the cabbage and cut it into small portions. 
Heat the oil ana add the cabbage. Stir for about 
3 minutes. No water should be necessary.
If you are using white-stemmed Chinese cab­
bage, separate the stems from the leaves. Stir-fry 
the stems for a minute, add a little water and 
cook for a couple of minutes. Add the green 
leaves and cook for further 2 minutes.
Add sugar or soy sauce to taste.

CAULIFLOWER
Brassica oleracea Botrytis
Sow seeds during November and December, 
transplant by February. Mulch when plants are 
well-established. Give plenty of fertiliser, watch for 
insect pests and soil deficiency problems. Choose 
early m aturing varieties to reduce some of the 
hazards of growing them. You may be lucky!
It is difficult to grow good cauliflowers if condi­
tions are poor and not enough care and attention 
are given to the development of a good, white 
curd. Moreover, they are prone to soil deficiency 
disorders 
like 
‘whiptail’. 
For 
the 
part-time 
gardener, buying cauliflowers at the vegetable 
markets is probably the only way to get superb 
specimens.
Cauliflower must not he overcooked. If you are 
cooking the whole head, take off the outside leaves, 
slash the base of the head and put it, stem down­
wards, into a pot. Add a cup of water, bring to the 
boil and cook for about 15 minutes. Cook the 
flowerets for about 5 minutes.
Baked Cauliflower
whole cooked 
2 cups milk
cauliflower 
nutmeg, grated
2 tablespoons butter 
cheese, mustard 
4 tablespoons flour
Make a cheese sauce by heating the butter and 
adding the flour. Stir for a minute and add the 
milk. Bring to the boil, cook gently for a few 
minutes and add the nutmeg, cheese and mus­
tard. Pour the sauce over the cauliflower, add 
more grated cheese, and brown in a hot oven.
Cauliflower and Lemon Juice
cooked cauliflower 
1 tablespoon olive oil 
flowerets 
juice of lemon
1 tablespoon butter
Heat the butter and oil, add the lemon juice. 
Add the flowerets and coat them with the mix­
ture. Keep on a low heat until the lemon juice 
has been absorbed and the cauliflower is heated 
through.

CAPSICUM
Capsicum annuum
Capsicum seeds can be dif ficult to germinate in a 
Canberra spring. Buy seedlings from a nursery 
and transplant in late October or November after 
the frosts have finished and the ground is warm. 
Clear the mulch, transplant about 30cm (1ft) apart, 
and return the mulch when the plant is established. 
As the fruit is setting, check to see that the bush 
itself does not obstruct the fruit. Use mulch to sup­
port the m aturing bush with its ripening fruit.
Capsicums, or peppers, are relatives of tomatoes 
and potatoes so they do well in similar conditions. 
They come in different shapes, sizes and colours, 
from the long thin Sweet Banana capsicum, the 
hell-shaped red, green and yellow capsicums to the 
tiny red hot chili. The flavour varies with the size, 
the large peppers are sweet and mild, the smaller 
ones eye-wateringly hot.
Although capsicums need a long time to m ature, 
five to seven months of warm weather, they are 
worth growing because of their high vitamin C 
content which increases as the fruit matures. The 
red hot chili can he grown as an ornamental bush 
and its fruit can be dried for use in curries or 
served chopped fresh as a side dish to ‘warm up’ 
otherwise mild curries.
Harvest the capsicums any time after the flesh 
feels firm. Make sure that the seeds are removed 
otherwise they will sour the dish. Capsicums are 
delicious raw, and slivers of raw capsicum and car­
rots are an excellent hors d ’oevre for children. 
Capsicums are essential for ratatouille described 
on page 32
Capsicums and Tomatoes
6 capsicums 
8 tomatoes, skinned
2 cloves garlic, 
chopped 
2 onions 
sliced
and chopped 
3 tablespoons olive 
oil 
basil
Remove the seeds and slice the capsicums into 
thick strips lengthways. Very gently fry the gar­
lic, onions and capsicums in tne oif in a covered 
pan for 10 minutes. T hen add the tomatoes and 
basil. Cook gently for another 10 minutes. The 
noula still he firm in the puree of

CARROTS
Daucus carota
Clear mulch from an area which has not had 
fresh m anure recently added to it, for m anure 
would make the roots forked and misshapen. Sow 
seeds from September to February using varieties 
that are resistant to the Motley Dwarf virus disease 
and are adaptable to summer growing and winter 
storage. 1'ry All Seasons, Topweight, Royal Red or 
Western Red and Amsterdam Forcing for baby 
carrots. Sow seeds fairly thickly and thin only if you 
want to . Your carrots may be a little smaller but it 
saves a lot of fuss.
2 onions 
carrots 
peeled
4 potatoes, peeled 
4 cups stock/water
and diced 
2 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons sugar 
parsley
Melt the butter and add the carrots, potatoes and 
onions. Gently stew them for about 15 minutes. 
Add the stock and cook until the vegetables are 
soft. Put through a blender or sieve. Reheat and 
serve with parsley.
Carrot Soup
6 medium si
Carrots in Honey
(A variation of the usual glazed carrots)
20 small carrots 
2 tablespoons butter
or sliced 
Vi cup stock
equivalent 
1 tablespoon honey
Melt all the ingredients in the butter and cook, 
covered, on a very low heat until almost all the 
liquid is absorbed and the carrots are tender. 
Shake the pan during the last stages of cooking.
Carrots have high yields for the space occupied, 
are delicious cooked or raw, will keep in the 
ground over winter and are a rich source of vita­
min A. However, they need some care in their cul­
tivation for maximum returns.
It is essential to keep the soil moist during ger­
mination: use a thin dam p mulch of compost, saw­
dust, hessian or dam p newspapers to help in dry, 
hot weather. When the very young plants emerge 
they still need constant watering. After they are 
established, carrots are a hardy vegetable.
If freshly pulled carrots survive children and 
salads to get to the pot, boil them gently for about 
10-15 minutes according to size. Do not overcook 
them.
Marinated Carrots
6 medium sized 
carrots
Vi cup white wine 
Vi cup wine vinegar
3 tablespoons oil 
1 clove garlic, 
crushed
bayleaf, parsley
Cook cleaned carrots for 5 minutes. Mix the 
wine, vinegar, garlic, bayleaf , and season to taste. 
Pour over the carrots and cook until tender. Add 
oil when cooking is almost complete. Serve the 
carrots when cold with parsley.

CELERY
Apium graveolens
Clear the mulch and sow or transplant self­
blanching celery from October to December. 
Return the mulch after the plants are well- 
established. If the plants are attacked by a leaf- 
spotting disease in humid weather in mid or late 
sum m er, spray with Bordeaux mixture. If uncon­
trolled, the brown and black spots make the celery 
useless.
To grow celery to the shape, size and appearance 
of those bunches available in the markets is a dif­
ficult and time-consuming task. Celery needs fer­
tile soil, lots of water, careful blanching to turn it 
white, and often needs spraying against a leaf spot­
ting disease. However, there is a self-blanching 
type much easier to grow.
Delicious Celery Soup
3 cups celery or 
3 tablespoons oil
celeriac, chopped 
4 cups stock
2 onions, chopped 
2 tablespoons cream
2 potatoes, chopped 
dill
Vi cup milk (optional)
Gently stew the celery, potato and onion in the 
butter in a covered pot for about 10 minutes. 
Add the stock and dill. Simmer for 20 minutes. 
Blend and add the milk if used. Bring the soup 
to the boil and add some more dill, ru t cream 
into the bottom of soup plates, add soup, mix 
and serve.

CELERIAC
Apium graveolens rapaceum is a root celery which re­
sembles a large turnip and it is the base which is 
eaten and can be used in stews, soups or shredded 
and blanched for use in salads. Sow from August to 
December. The m ature roots will winter over in 
the ground.

CUCUMBERS
Cucumis sativus
Sow when the weather is warm, from October to 
December or transplant seedlings from November 
to January. Clear the mulch, plant 2 or 3 seeds in 
the same spot, return a thin layer of mulch and 
keep the area well-watered throughout germ ina­
tion. As cucumbers need lots of water during their 
growing season as well, return a thick layer of 
mulch to the vines as soon as possible, making sure 
the ground is well-watered underneath.
Cucumber Soup
3 peeled and pureed 
cucumbers (reserve 
some for garnish)
4 cups stock 
2 tablespoons
butter
Boil pureed cucumbers in stock for 10 minutes. 
Fry tne onion and garlic in butter until soft and 
transparent. Add to soup. Chill the soup, stir in 
the cream and serve witn chopped herbs.
1 onion chopped 
1 garlic clove 
crushed 
1 cup cream 
parsley, chives
Cucumbers in Sour Cream
2 cucumbers, 
3 tablespoons chopped
unpeeled and 
dill, chives and
sliced very thinly 
parsley
*/2 cup sour cream
Put tne cucumbers into a colander with plenty of 
salt and leave for 30 minutes. Drain ana squeeze 
excess moisture from slices. Stir the cucumbers 
gently into the sour cream and herbs. Season 
with salt, pepper and sugar.
For growing cylindrical cucumbers, a trellis is 
needed. Apple cucumbers can wander happily 
over the ground without the fruit becoming mis­
shapen. The hybrid burpless variety is a very suc­
cessful cucumber which can satisfy many palates 
and digestions but it needs a trellis for the fruit to 
hang down. 1 he small pickling cucumbers are 
worth the effort if the family likes them pickled.
With luck there will be plenty of bees around to 
pollinate the flowers. Don’t worry if cucumbers 
drop off before m aturing, the vines will only set as 
much fruit as they can mature. Pick the fruit 
before they turn yellow; they become sour if over­
ripe.

KOHL RABI
Brassica oleracea cauloropa
Sow seeds in September and October for an 
early summer harvest, or February and March for 
an autumn and winter harvest. Sow seeds in hand­
fuls of soil on top of the mulch. Keep moist until 
seedlings are established.
Kohl rabi is one of the cabbage family but it is 
grown chiefly for the thickened turnip-like stem 
which grows above the ground. The bulb has a 
celery flavour and the leaves can be used like 
spinach. It grows well in Canberra, can survive 
heat, although lack of water will make them woody, 
and is free of the pests and diseases that usually 
attack brassicas. Kohl rabi will winter over in the 
ground.
Kohl Rabi in Wine

LEEKS
A Ilium porrum
If you are growing from seed, plant from 
August to November. Plant seeds thickly in a small 
area cleared of mulch. W hen the seedlings are 
strong, transplant. In a mulch garden, transplant 
by making a hole through the mulch and deep into 
the soil. Put each leek into one of the holes, return 
the soil and the mulch. T here is no need for com­
plicated blanching techniques.
Leek Soup (Vichyssoise)
4 leeks, cleaned 
butter
and chopped 
4 cups good stock
4 potatoes, diced
Melt the leeks and potatoes in butter. Add stock 
and cook for 40 minutes. Blend.
To make vichyssoise, serve the soup cold with 1 
cup of cream stirred through it.
2 rashers ham or 
bacon, chopped
3 eggs
1 cup cream
Leek Quiche
pastry
2 tablespoons butter 
6 white stems of 
leeks, cleaned 
and chopped 
Line a dish with pastry. Melt the chopped leeks 
in butter, add ham or bacon. Spread the mixture 
over pastry. Beat the eggs and cream, pour over 
the leeks and cook in hot oven for 30-40 
minutes.
Growing leeks is an easy introduction to growing 
onions, so easy in fact that it is hardly worth the 
effort to grow bulb onions.
When leeks become established in the garden, 
you can gauge for yourself when the seedlings 
need transplanting because m ature leeks produce 
seedlings that grow from the main stem. Leeks 
grow all year round in Canberra.
Leeks in Red Wine
6 leeks, washed 
1 small glass red wine
3 tablespoons olive 
2 tablespoons water 
oil
Heat the olive oil and gently fry the leeks on all 
sides till they change colour a little. Add the 
wine and water, cover the pan and cook for 
10 minutes. Put the leeks onto a serving dish, 
reduce the sauce, pour over leeks and serve.
Leeks ä la Grecque
6 leeks, washed 
1 cup water
Vi cup olive oil 
1 cup white wine
2 teaspoons 
coriander seeds
Chop the leeks across into 4 pieces, put them 
into a large frying pan and add the other ingre­
dients. Bring to the boil, and cook gently, stirring 
frequently, until the leeks are cooked and the 
sauce is reduced. Serve hot or cold.

LETTUCE
Lactuca sativa
Sow seeds thinly in an area cleared of mulch. 
Keep moist during germination. Thin the seed­
lings if necessary.
Lettuce is a must in any garden. With thoughtful 
selection of different varieties it is possible to have 
a continuous supply throughout the year. There 
are so many types on the market that it is a con­
tinual surprise and disappointment that the only 
ones available at the greengrocers are the Iceberg 
or cabbage-type lettuces which seem to become 
more tasteless every season.
For the part-time gardener, choosing a few reli­
able varieties and planting some of each at regular 
intervals from August to April should satisfy the 
need for fresh salad greens. Freshly harvested, 
their vitamin content and flavour are at a 
maximum.
Lettuce likes cool weather, rich soil and more 
water than most vegetables. 1 hey can bolt to seed if 
conditions are poor. Choose non-hearting lettuces, 
like mignonettes, that will do well in summer and 
winter. If you are lucky enough to get some ‘lace’ 
or ‘Greek’ lettuce your spring, early summer and 
autumn lettuce supply is guaranteed. The lace let­
tuce has no heart and the leaves are harvested as 
needed. They will produce over a long period of 
time and if the centre is nipped out as the weather 
gets hotter they will not go to seed and the harvest 
will be prolonged. If they do go to seed allow them 
to self sow and next year’s harvest is guaranteed. 
They grow in spring and autumn either from seed 
or from roots left in the ground.
If you are adventurous and wish to take the time 
and make the effort, try other lettuces for summer 
and winter and include the delicious Cos lettuce in 
your autumn and winter harvest.
Snails are a problem with young seedlings but 
will not cross a narrow trail of sawdust.
Serve lettuce as salad with a good dressing and 
herbs. Add other summer vegetables to taste. 
Cooked lettuce is faintly decadent.
They (the rabbits) did not awake because the lettuces 
had been so soporific

ONIONS
Allium cepa
If you use seedlings when they are available in 
the nurseries from February to August, try plant­
ing them in a thin layer of mulch. Although this 
defies the traditional method of growing onions in 
bare soil, onions will develop thick bulbs in the 
usual manner.
Onions
If you are growing from seed, clear an area of 
mulch and sow seed thinly. Do not return the 
mulch but let the onions grow closely together and 
you will reduce weed problems.
If you are growing large quantities of onions for 
storage then a specialist gardening book will be of 
use to determ ine when to plant, what varieties and 
cultivation techniques to help produce onions that 
will keep well. For the leisurely gardener, chives, 
garlic, shallots and tree onions are trouble-free 
onions for a predictable and regular harvest.
The onions are ready to harvest when the green 
stems turn yellow and topple over. If they are to be 
stored, the onions must be carefully dried in the 
sun for anything up to three weeks. Store them in a 
dry, airy dark spot. Thick stemmed onions will not 
store well.
Tree Onions
Allium cepa var. aggragatum
Free onions are perennials which produce small 
onions at the top of the stalks and medium sized 
onions at the base. The very small onions are used 
for pickling or replanting while the base onions are 
used in the normal way. They are easier to grow 
than globe onions and are an ideal substitute for 
other onions if space is limited. If dried carefully, 
they keep well.
French Onion Soup
3 tablespoons butter 
10 medium sized onions 
3 tablespoons flour 
10 cups stock 
Peel and slice the onions into thick rounds. Melt 
the butter in a saucepan. Add the onions and fry 
until golden and translucent. DO NOT BROWN 
otherwise they will become bitter. Add the flour 
and stir gently for about 2 minutes. Add stock, 
bring to boil and simmer for 20 minutes.
To serve: 6 slices French bread 
gruyere cheese, grated
Fry French bread in butter till crisp or toast the 
bread and butter it. Put the bread in the bottom 
of the soup bowls and sprinkle with the cheese. 
Pour in soup. Add more cheese if necessary. Let 
the bowls stand until the cheese melts.
Pickled Onions
20 small onions 
1 dessertspoon
or shallots 
allspice berries
1 dessertspoon 
1 dessertspoon salt
peppercorns 
4 cups brown vinegar
Skin the onions and put into jars. Bruise the 
peppercorns and allspice and acid to the vinegar 
with salt. Pour the vinegar over onions until 
liquid is finger width deep over the onions. Seal 
jars with waxed paper.
Glazed Onions
15 small onions 
Vi glass sherry
4 tablespoons butter 
1 glass water 
3 tablespoons sugar
Soak the onions in cold water for a few minutes. 
Peel them and put them into a pan in the heated 
butter. Stir for 10 minutes, add sugar, sherry 
and water. Cook until liquid is syrupy and onions 
soft.

PARSNIPS
Peucedanum sativum
Parsnip Chips
Slice parsnips into thin sticks. Deep fry until 
brown.
Remove mulch from the area, sow fresh seed 
thinly from September to December for autum n 
and winter harvests. T here should be no need for 
thinning. In humid, wet autum n weather parsnips 
may be affected by a powdery mildew. Try Bor­
deaux mixture.
Parsnips are a hardy root vegetable which grow 
well in Canberra and will keep in the ground over 
winter. They do not seem to be used as a table 
vegetable as commonly as in years past; however, 
these recipes may do something to restore their 
popularity.
Parsnips need similar cultivation techniques to 
carrots but three things must be remem bered: they 
are much deeper rooting than carrots, they take 
longer to germinate and the surface soil needs to 
be kept moist during germination.
strips 
1 cup water
Fry the parsnip strips in the butter, add other 
ingredients and bring to the boil. Cook un­
covered until the liquid is reduced and the 
parsnips cooked.
Parsnip Pie
6 parsnips, 
scrubbed and 
grated
4 medium sized 
tomatoes, skinned 
and sliced
5 tablespoons oil
3 tablespoons butter 
1 cup grated cheese 
1 cup cream
4 tablespoons fresh 
white breadcrumbs
Heat the oil in a pan and fry the parsnips lightly 
for about 3 minutes. Grease a casserole dish with 
half the butter, place a layer of parsnips over the 
bottom and pour a little cream over them. Cover 
with a layer of tomatoes, some more cream and 
some cheese. Repeat these layers until the ingre­
dients are used up. Top with breadcrumbs and 
dot with butter. Cook in m oderate oven for 40 
minutes.

PEAS
Pisum sativum
•  clear an area of mulch, sow a num ber of seeds 
in one spot and return the mulch when the 
plants are growing strongly. They will need 
some support,
•  spread seeds under dam p mulch and stake 
when growing strongly,
•  plant telephone peas near m aturing corn or 
close to a trellis.
Fresh Pea Soup
(A delightful luxury.)
2 cups shelled peas 
5 cups good stock 
1 potato, peeled 
V2 cup cream
and thinly sliced 
1 egg yolk
1 onion, thinly 
croutons (optional)
sliced
Boil the peas, potato and onion in stock for 20 
minutes. Put them through the blender and 
return to the pot. Beat the cream and egg yolk 
together lightly and add to the soup. Reheat but 
do not boil. Serve with croutons.
Freshly harvested peas are reward enough for the 
care needed to grow them. Peas prefer cool to 
warm weather so if you plan to grow them 
throughout summer try to Find a position that will 
give them some shade.
There are many kinds to choose from: bush or 
climbing peas, snap peas which can be eaten whole 
when im mature and sugar peas which are grown to 
be eaten whole.
Peas can be grown before the frosts finish but if 
they are m aturing heavy frosts will prevent the 
flowers setting pods.
If fresh peas survive the depredations of child­
ren, harvest them before they begin to crinkle. If 
they survive shelling and salads, try the following 
recipes.
To cook sugar peas: Remove the stalks from the 
peas and cook them in their pods in boiling water 
for about 20-30 minutes. Serve with chopped herbs 
and melted butter.
Buttered peas: Put 4 cups of shelled peas into a 
pot with 1 cup of water, 2 tablespoons butter, salt 
and pepper, a pinch of sugar, and some parsley or 
mint. Bring to the boil, remove the lid and gently 
cook till water has evaporated.
I eat my peas with honey 
I’ve done it all my life 
They do taste kind of funny 
But it keeps them on the knife

POTATOES
Solanum tuberosum
Plant certified seed potatoes bought from the 
nursery from as early as August. 1'ry to get small 
seed potatoes but if the potatoes are large, cut 
them so that there is an eye, or shoot, in the por­
tion to be planted.
If you have the space, growing potatoes in deep 
mulch is very simple. Try grow ing just a few even 
in a small garden for their superior quality and 
taste will convince you that you will need a bigger 
crop next season.
If you are starting your potato patch in an un­
mulched garden, then place the potatoes on top of 
watered soil in rows about 30cm (lft) apart and 
allow about 30cm (lft) between them. Cover with 
mulch to about 15cm (bin) and water well. When 
potato shoots appear, cover them with another 
layer of mulch, otherwise green tubers will grow 
through the decomposing mulch.
N.B. green potatoes are poisonous.
If your garden is already a mulch garden, put 
the seed potatoes about 15cm (bin) into the mulch. 
Water well. Cover green shoots with another layer 
of mulch if the mulch shows signs of decomposing 
too much.
You should not have to water too regularly, but 
make sure the garden does not dry out completely.
Harvest the potatoes according to the size you 
want. If the skin is soft they are ‘new’ potatoes and 
not suitable for storage, if the skin is hard they are 
‘old’ potatoes and are suitable for storage. The 
more m ature the potato, the better the cooking 
quality. You can leave your potato crop in the 
ground after the frosts have killed the tops and 
harvest them as you please. Make sure you harvest 
them before the next spring otherwise they will 
sprout again.
Boil or steam ‘new’ potatoes and use ‘old’ 
potatoes for baking. Avoid peeling the potatoes if 
possible as the nutrients are close to the skin. With 
potatoes grown in deep mulch, skins are very 
clean.
Potato Peel Soup
peels from b-7 large potatoes, cut into bmm 
(*4in) strips
1 large onion, chopped 
1 clove garlic
2 carrots, chopped 
5 cups stock
1 small stalk celery, chopped
Put all the ingredients into a pot and boil gently 
for an hour. Put into a blender and return to the 
pot. Reheat. Add chopped parsley and serve.
Potato Casserole
Grease a casserole dish. Add thinly sliced 
potatoes and nearly cover with milk. Sprinkle 
with nutmeg. Cover completely with grated 
cheese and dot with butter. Cook for an hour in 
a moderate oven.
Potato Cakes
Grate potatoes, add egg and flour to bind. Make 
into small cakes and fry until golden.

PUMPKINS
Sow seeds from October if the weather is warm, 
transplant until December. Put a few seeds of dif­
ferent kinds of pum pkin and squash that suit fam­
ily and individual tastes into handfuls of compost 
or soil on top of the mulch. Cover with a handful 
or so of loose mulch if you want to protect the soil 
and help germinate the seeds.
Pumpkins, marrows, squash and gourds are all 
members of the cucurbit family which includes 
cucumbers and zucchini, both of which are dealt 
with separately.
Pumpkins have a firm er texture, keep longer 
and have more nourishm ent than either summer 
squash or marrows but there seems to be little 
precision about the naming of varieties across the 
Atlantic and the confusion has spread to Australia.
Enthusiasm for large winter pumpkins can wane 
when the gardener-cook is faced with very large 
pumpkins, lots of them to store and a relatively 
unenthusiastic 
family 
continually 
faced 
with 
pumpkin for dinner. Grow smaller varieties, like 
Butternut, which are a good quality pumpkin with 
a reasonable storage life.
l ry the delicious sum m er squash, Green Button, 
a high yielding squash with fruit that are picked at 
a very immature stage. Cook them the same way as 
zucchini, either whole or sliced.
All cucurbits like warm growing conditions with 
plenty of moisture. Choose a spot in your garden, 
perhaps by a fence, which will cope with growing 
vines that will spread over a large area. Because 
they do take up so much space, don’t be tem pted to 
plant too many if your garden is small — you will 
not have the space for other vegetables.
For the adventurous, there are a num ber of in­
teresting pumpkins and squash on the market of
considerable curiosity value. Sow some ornamental 
gourds where there is a gap in the garden. Use the 
fruit as indoor decoration or gifts.
Vegetable spaghetti is another curiosity. It is a 
high yielding squash which when cooked whole has 
a tasty spaghetti-like flesh inside.
Pumpkins and squash can be boiled and pureed, 
baked or used in pies and soups.
Pumpkin Soup
Boil some pum pkin in light stock or water till 
tender. Slice and fry some onions until they are 
crisp and start to blacken. Put the pum pkin, 
stock, onion and some milk into a blender. Puree 
and reheat. For an extra dash add a splash of 
chili sauce.
Barry’s Bread
(for 3 loaves)
3 cups pumpkin puree 
2 cups mixture of chopped
dates, nuts, raisins to taste
4 teaspoons baking soda 
4 cups wholemeal/white flour
mixture
Mix the ingredients thoroughly and put into the 
greased pans. Cook in a m oderate oven till done, 
about 1-1 x/i hours. Test by putting a fine skewer 
into loaves.
xk  cup 
wheatgerm 
or bran 
1 cup oil 
1 cup sugar

RADISH
Raphanus sativus
Sow sum m er seeds thinly from Septem ber to 
February in an area cleared of mulch. Sow varieties 
that suit family tastes, for some are hotter than 
others. Small sowings at regular intervals will 
probably provide an adequate supply. Make sure 
that winter radishes are sown by January and 
February.
Radishes are easy to grow and they m ature quickly. 
Provided they get enough water to make them 
crisp and firm, they are invariably successful.
T here are many kinds on the market, varying in 
shape, size, colour and flavour. Although they are 
usually grown for summer salads and snacks, there 
are winter radishes that will remain in the ground 
for use over winter.
Fry cooking radishes for a change.
Boiled Radishes
Peel or scrape some radishes, blanch them in 
salted water for 5 minutes. Gently simmer them 
in a good stock for another few minutes. Add 
some cream if you want to be extravagant.
SALSIFY
Tragapogan porrifolius
Sow seeds of either the white or black-rooted 
salsify between October and December in an area 
cleared of mulch. Sow thinly so there will be no 
need for thinning. The salsify will be m ature by 
late autum n.
Salsify is a deep-rooted vegetable that needs the 
same conditions as carrots and parsnips and like 
them can stay in the ground over winter. Salsify is 
grown for its roots, which have a flavour reminis­
cent of oysters.
Prepare the roots for cooking by cleaning well 
and leaving them in salted water to prevent discol­
ouration. Boil them for about 40 minutes. Rub off 
the skin, serve hot with butter.
Salsify Fritters
Scrub roots carefully to get rid of hair roots, 
(irate. Add some egg ana flour (1 tablespoon 
flour to each egg) to bind. Fry small quantities 
until brown on both sides.

SILVER BEET
Beta vulgaris var. cicla
Sow seeds or transplant seedlings from  Sep­
tem ber to January in an area cleared o f mulch. 
W hen the plants are growing vigorously, return 
the mulch. Silver Beet is a biennial, so it will crop 
until the second season when it will go to seed. If 
your soil has not developed a reasonable level of 
fertility, use a seaweed fertiliser to encourage leaf 
growth.
Silver Beet, or Swiss Chard as it is sometimes 
called, is the standby for the indolent gardener. It 
is easy to grow and bears well right throughout the 
year. It is nutritious and provided it is not boiled to 
a soggy mess, delicious. In recent years multi­
coloured varieties have been introduced so your 
garden can have the splendour of Rainbow Chard 
or Ruby Chard.
Harvest m ature outside leaves regularly. Cook 
the leaves and the stems together if you wish, or 
the leafy part separately.
If silver beet is cooked imaginatively, children 
will dem and more. To prepare silver beet for 
everyday cooking, thinly slice the well-washed leafy 
part. Melt some butter in a saucepan and add the 
still dam p leaves. Do not add any water. Cover and 
cook very gently until the leaves change their col­
our from  green to dark green. Do not over-cook. 
Give the dish an extra dash by adding nutm eg or 
lemon juice.
SPINACH
Spinacia oleracea
Clear an area of mulch and sow English spinach 
in August and Septem ber for a late spring harvest. 
Sow seeds again in January and February for 
autum n and winter harvests. W ater and fertilise 
regularly. Spinach will not do well in hot condi­
tions.
The indolent gardener has not the time to tend 
true English spinach. However, as it is a culinary 
delight, the ambitious gardener may be prepared 
to devote more time and trouble to it. It is not easy 
to grow well because growing conditions must be 
good and care must be taken with its cultivation 
otherwise it will either grow too slowly or bolt to 
seed. If you don’t have great success, be happy with 
silver beet.
You can harvest spinach leaf by leaf but the usual 
thing is to harvest the whole plant when it is 
m ature. Carefully wash the leaves before prepar­
ing for the table — grit in the final dish is not easy 
to pass off as pepper.
Spinach is delicious raw as a salad. If cooking 
spinach, use the same recipe as for silver beet, that 
is, melt the leaves in butter until the leaves change 
colour.

NEW ZEALAND SPINACH
Tetragonia expansa
Transplant runners in Canberra in September 
for a sum m er harvest. It will not survive winter. If 
you can get seeds, soak them overnight in a diluted 
seaweed mixture before planting.
For those who go regularly to the coast, it is easy to 
find runners of New Zealand spinach for it grows 
like a weed near many beaches. It is a very con­
venient leafy green because only the top tender 
leaves are cropped as needed. At the coast, it grows 
all year round.
Treat the leaves like other spinach.
W hen cooking your leafy green vegetables, try a 
m ixture of vegetables, sorrel, spinach, silver beet, 
some lettuce leaves, the tops of kohl rabi. If such a 
m ixture is pureed and turned into a sauce with 
onions and a little stock, it is delicious served with 
fine pasta and parmesan cheese.
All these spinach vegetables go well with eggs.
For large quantities of leafy green vegetables: In 
a large pot of boiling water, parboil the stalks, then 
add washed and chopped leaves little by little so 
they will not go off the boil. When the spinach has 
wilted, pour into a sieve and douse with cold water. 
The wilted spinach can be kept in the refrigerator 
for a few days, can be frozen, or can be used 
immediately for spinach recipes.
Cheese and Spinach Pie
12 sheets phyllo pastry 1 cup hot milk

SWEET CORN 
Cook the cobs in plenty of boiling water lor any-
Zea mays var. saccharata 
thing Irom 5-10 minutes according to the size and
freshness of the cob. Serve with butter. O ther 
recipes seem a bit pointless with freshly harvested 
corn, with the possible exception of corn fritters.
When the weather and ground are warm, clear 
the mulch from some small areas, plant 3 or 4 
seeds together. Plant about 6-8 blocks for a family 
of four. Continue planting in this way every 3 
weeks from October to November if you have the 
space. By planting in blocks, you have greater 
chances of pollination and the coVn stalks will be 
able to provide support for each other. Return the 
mulch to the base of the corn after the plants are 
established. Throw a few pea seeds around the 
growing corn, they can then use the corn for sup­
port, give a crop of peas and when the crop is 
finished, the pea bushes can be cut and put under 
the mulch.

Eating your own freshly harvested sweet corn is 
one of the garden’s great pleasures. Flavour and 
succulence rapidly disappear after harvesting so 
cook the cobs immediately.
The only troublesome pests are caterpillars that 
crawl inside the ears of corn and eat the kernels. 
Keep a watch on them and remove by hand.
Harvest the corn after the silk (the browny- 
yellow tendrils at the end of the cob) withers and 
the cob feels firm if pressed. When the harvest is 
finished, chop the stalks and roots and cover them 
with mulch. By next spring they will have broken 
down enough to plant other crops.

TOMATO
Lycopersicum esculentum
Clear an area of mulch which you know is 
reasonably fertile. Sow seeds from October to 
November after the frosts have finished, or trans­
plant to December. If you are putting in tomatoes 
that need staking put the stakes in at the same time. 
Set the seeds or plants about 45cm (18in) to 60cm 
(2ft) apart. When the plants are sturdy, return 
dam p mulch thickly to the base.
Every home gardener grows tomatoes. T here has 
been a decline in the taste and texture of 
tomatoes available at the markets because profes­
sional gardeners must pick, package and often 
chemically treat unripened fruit so that they will 
appear unblemished to the consumer. Those taste­
less apparitions are incentive enough to grow one’s 
own.
You can grow tomatoes from seed if you wish or 
buy healthy seedlings of different kinds. Tall vari­
eties need staking and sometimes pruning. The 
bush and dw arf types need neither. Some tomatoes 
are resistant to wilt and nematodes; some are early 
croppers, some late. Remember that if you buy 
hybrid varieties, the seedlings during the next 
season will not grow true to type.
Don’t restrict yourself to the one type of tomato, 
in some seasons one variety will do better than 
another. Tomatoes can be as unpredictable from 
year to year as any other vegetable.
fry  these varieties:
Grosse Lisse: tall growing tomato which needs 
staking and some pruning, mid to late season 
cropper with large fruit.
Earliest of All: bush variety that needs neither 
staking or pruning. Fruit of medium size.
Burnley Gem and Burnley Surecrop: no prun­
ing necessary but staking may be needed for 
Surecrop. Resistant to wilt.
Rouge de M armande: popular early cropper 
which can be susceptible to wilt.
Tiny Tim: a m iniature tomato bush with tiny 
fruit that can be used whole in salads.
Cloche: If you want to give your tomatoes a start 
before you think the frost period is over, use a 
cloche. A cloche will protect the plant during cold 
nights, heat the soil during the day and provide 
moisture for the young plant. The easiest way to 
make a cloche is to cut the bottom off a large plastic 
bottle and put it over the plant. Leave the lid off 
the bottle so air can circulate.
Pruning: Arguments for heavy pruning of tall 
growing tomatoes do not seem very convincing as 
the only effect seems to be to reduce the quantity 
of fruit that will grow in favour of its size. The 
indolent gardener should make sure that the tall- 
growing tomatoes are staked well and pruned 
judiciously to keep the bush under control.
Care with early cultivation will avoid one of the 
most common tomato problems — blossom end 
rot. When the plants are young, they need regular 
watering particularly if the weather is dry. Irregu­
lar watering and drought may cause the blossom 
end of the tomato to become water-soaked and 
brown.
If tomatoes are still bearing at the beginning of 
the cold weather, you can take out the stakes and 
carefully lay the bushes on top of the straw so the 
fruit has a chance of ripening at ground level. 
Spread bush varieties in the same way.
Few foods are more delightful than fresh 
tomatoes sliced into a salad with chopped herbs 
and a touch of oil and vinegar. Tomatoes are 
delicious in cold sum m er soups such as gazpacho 
or the hot soup described below.
To peel tomatoes, leave them in a bowl of boiling 
or very hot water for a couple of minutes. Dip 
them into cold water and then peel off the skin.
59

--- Page 68 ---
To prepare tomatoes for stuffing, slice off the 
stem end, loosen the pulp with a spoon, salt the 
inside surface and leave them to drain upside 
down for 10 minutes. T he pulp will come away 
easily without dam aging the skin.
If you have a glut of tomatoes, peel, seed and 
puree them. Simmer until the sauce is thick and 
smooth. Freeze in ice cube trays.
Grilled Tomatoes and Bacon
(A delicious brunch.)
Cut some tomatoes in half. Score the surface of 
the tomatoes, sprinkle with chopped garlic and 
basil. Grill until the flesh is soft. Serve with 
grilled bacon.
Gazpacho
1 slice bread 
1 stick celery
5-6 tomatoes 
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 capsicum 
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 cucumber, peeled
2 cups of water or m ixture of tomato juice and 
water
Blend the bread, tomatoes (keep one), half the 
capsicum, cucumber and celery. Add oil, vinegar 
and blend until smooth. Add water or mixture of 
tomato juice and water. Chill. Serve with rem ain­
ing finely chopped vegetables.
Tomato Soup
Melt 6 or 7 large, fresh tomatoes that have been 
skinned and chopped in some olive oil. Add a 
clove of garlic and some chopped basil. Cook 
gently for 5 minutes, add enougn stock to make 
it soupy and cook another 5 minutes. Serve with

TURNIPS
Swede Turnips
Brassica napobrassica
White Turnips
Brassica rapa
Pureed Turnips
Use either white turnips or swedes. Swedes will 
take longer to cook. Clean and peel 4 or 5 
turnips, dice or slice them and gently boil for 
10-20 minutes until soft. Drain off the liquid, 
mash or puree them with butter and a little milk.
I'hinly sow swede turnips in December and 
January. Lightly mulch the seeded area until the 
seedlings are well established, and return the 
mulch. They need constant moisture.
Sow white turnips in August and September, and 
again in January to March in an area cleared of 
mulch. Return dam p mulch as soon as possible as 
they need plenty of moisture.
Cheese Turnip
2 medium swedes, 
cleaned, diced and 
cooked
2 cups cooked leafy 
greens
1 cup cottage cheese
Butter a casserole dish 
cubes. Put in half the 
half of the various c
1 cup mozzarella 
cheese, diced 
Vi cup hard grated 
cheese
1 cup breadcrumbs 
3 cups tomato sauce
(p. 60)
nd put in half the turnip 
;reen vegetables. Spread 
eeses and breadcrumbs
over the turnips and greens. Pour over half the 
tomato sauce. Repeat for a second layer. Bake 
uncovered for 30 minutes in a moderate oven.
Turnips are quite sweet as a vegetable but the 
swede is sweeter. T hin slices of swede served raw
give a lift to winter salads, children, too, often eat 
them as a pre-dinner snack.
Swede turnips are the most useful turnips for the 
low-labour, deep mulch garden — they are grown 
for 
autum n 
and 
winter 
harvest, 
will 
not 
deteriorate too quickly in the ground and are a 
useful winter vegetable. White turnips deteriorate 
quickly if not harvested at maturity.
Harvest swedes from the size of small potatoes if 
you wish. Use both white turnips and swedes in 
soups and casseroles as flavouring. If you have a 
prejudice against them as a vegetable in their own 
right, try some of the following recipes.

ZUCCHINI
Cucurbita Pepo L.
Sow 2 or 3 seeds, or transplant healthy seedlings 
in a handful of soil or compost in the mulch. Keep 
seeds moist until they are germinated. Return the 
mulch as soon as possible.
Easy to grow, invariably successful and prolific 
croppers, summer squash is an invaluable vege­
table.
Harvest the young marrows as regularly as pos­
sible, at 10cm (4in) if they are to be used whole in 
cooking or 18cm (7in) if they are to be sliced or 
grated. If you want to reduce your zucchini har­
vest, leave the fruit on the plant.
Zucchini is delicious in a num ber of ways: sliced 
into sticks and served raw as a salad, served in 
ratatouille, as a soup, stuffed and baked or as a 
casserole. Vary your methods of preparation; 
grated zucchini can give a favourite recipe quite a 
lift.
Zucchini soup (or how to cope with that mon­
strous crop)
4 cups zucchini, grated 2 tablespoons oil 
2 onions, sliced 
4 cups stock
Melt the zucchini and onion in the heated oil. 
Add the stock and simmer gently for 30 minutes. 
Serve with chopped herbs.

6 small zucchini,

1 clove garlic, chopped
1-2 tablespoons butter nutm eg

Sprinkle zucchini with salt and leave to drain for 
10 minutes. Heat the butter in a large pan, add 
the garlic and the zucchini, fry gently until the 
zucchini change colour. Add cream and allow 
mixture to thicken and reduce over medium 
heat. Add 2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese 
and stir till melted. Serve with cooked fettucine 
or egg noodles and the rest of the cheese.

HERBS
Herbs will brighten your gardening and cooking. 
Many of the herbs are perennials so their care is 
minimal after they are established, the greatest 
problem being to keep them under control.
This is not an exhaustive list of aromatic or 
medicinal herbs, rather a list of easily grown culin­
ary herbs that do well in Canberra and have some 
specific contribution to make in spicing our cook­
ing.
Balm
Melissa officinalis
Often called lemon balm because of its lemon- 
scented leaves, balm is an easy perennial to grow. It 
likes similar conditions to mint and will spread in 
the same way. If protected from frosts, some leaves 
will survive the winter.
Use the leaves in salads to add a subtle and dis­
tinctive flavour and aroma.
Basil
Sweet Basil 
Bush Basil
Ocimum basilicum 
Ocimum minimum
Both varieties are annuals which do not survive 
the first frosts if grown out-of-doors. Sow in spring 
and when the plant is established, nip out the flow­
ering buds to extend the life of the plant.
Basil should be grown am ong tomatoes as it has a 
reputation for repelling nematodes and protecting 
tomatoes from insect pests. As well its finest affin­
ity in cooking is with tomatoes.
Use it with raw tomatoes in salads, in tomato 
purees, with baked tomato and tomato juice. 1'ry 
using basil with egg recipes.
Pesto Sauce
Use this delicious sauce for all kinds of pasta and 
as flavouring for soup.
Pound a large bunch of basil leaves with 1 or 2 
cloves of garlic, a little salt and a handf ul of pine 
nuts. Add a couple of tablespoons of parmesan 
cheese. Slowly add enough olive oil to amalga­
mate with the other ingredients so that the sauce 
is thick.
Chives
Allium shoenoprasum
Chives thrive anywhere. Use them as a garden 
border, divide the clumps in spring for a contin­
uous supply in spring and summer. Cut them back 
to their base in winter if it looks as though any pests 
or diseases show an interest. Grow garlic chives 
for a mild garlic flavour. Russian chives grow 
throughout the winter.
Coriander
Coriander sativum
Grow coriander in spring. 
o seed you
will have plenty of new plants for the following 
season. The lacy leaves are commonly used in 
oriental dishes as a garnish. The seeds are f ragrant 
and spicy, and can be used in a variety of oriental 
and middle eastern dishes. It can be used instead 
of parsley.
Dill
Anethum graveolens
Sow seeds in spring. Like many other herbs, dill 
will, if left to seed, regrow next season. Dill and 
fennel are very similar herbs, the dill the milder of 
the two.
Use the leaves when cooking fish, they will 
reduce the smells. Use the seeds in coleslaw, in 
bread and in making pickled cucumbers.
63

--- Page 72 ---
Garlic
Allium sativum
Grow garlic in autum n in strategic places in the 
garden as a deterrent to bugs. Plant cloves from 
healthy, large bulbs you buy at the market. They 
will be ready to harvest when the stems turn yellow 
and topple over. Dry them thoroughly in the sun if 
there is a large crop.
Horseradish
Cochlearia armoracia
Grow horseradish if you are addicted to fresh 
horseradish sauce. However, grow it in a pot 
otherwise it will become a pest in the garden.
Grate or mince horseradish in a blender if you 
have one for it affects eyes more than onions do.
Horseradish Sauce
Grate horseradish, season and add some cream 
to make a mayonnaise-like consistency.
Marjoram 
Sweet Maijoram
Origanum onites 
Origanum majorana
Oregano
Marjoram vulgare
Oregano and marjoram are related species and 
are similar in appearance and flavour. O regano is 
regarded as wild marjoram. Both are easy-to-grow 
perennials with soft green leaves and attractive 
flowers. They are valuable winter herbs. Use them 
in soups, stews, as a garnish for vegetables and as 
flavouring in meat sauce. They are indispensable 
in pizza and bolognese sauce recipes.
Mints
Mentha spp.
T here are many aromatic and culinary varieties 
of mint. They will all grow from seed or runners in
spring, they all like plenty of water, and they all 
have ram pant root systems.
Use mints for tea, drinks, salads, flavouring for 
carrots and peas. For mint sauce try using apple- 
mint as a change from the more common curly 
mint.
Mint Sauce
To make a small jug of mint sauce, Finely chop 
about Vi cup of mint and put it into the jug. Add 
1Vi tablespoons of sugar, pour on 3 tablespoons 
boiling water and add Vi cup vinegar. Use less 
mint it it is dried mint.
Parsley
Petroselinum crispum
Parsley is an almost indispensible culinary herb, 
and with mint, is likely to be the most common 
herb found in any garden.
Apart from the common curled variety, there 
are other varieties — Italian parsley, Ham burg 
parsley, moss curled parsley.
Parsley is a biennial. If you plant seeds or seed­
lings in spring they will grow throughout the year 
and go to seed the following summer. Because 
germination is very, very slow, plant healthy seed­
lings bought from a nursery.
Parsley is rich in vitamins and iron. Pick it and 
use it immediately. As a culinary herb it is very 
versatile as a garnish and flavouring in soups, cas­
seroles, sauces, and salads.
Try deep freezing parsley in some water in ice 
cubes if it looks as if your parsley will not survive 
until the next crop is ready.
Rosemary
Rosemarinus officinalis
Rosemary is an attractive, grey-green bush with 
fragrant leaves. Buy a young plant and transplant 
it to a sunny and sheltered spot.
Use it judiciously as a flavouring for meats, p ar­
ticularly roast meats.
64

--- Page 73 ---
Sage
Salvia officinalis
Sage is an evergreen perennial which will grow 
into a handsome spreading ground cover if condi­
tions are right.
Sage and Onion Stuffing
4 onions, chopped 
2 tablespoons butter 
7 fresh sage leaves 
1 cup stale bread 
Boil the onions for 5 minutes. Dip the sage into 
boiling water for 2 minutes then chop. Mix the 
ingredients. Use this stuffing for fatty meats: 
duck, turkey or chicken.
Shallots
Allium ascalonium
Shallots are a perennial usually grown from bulbs. 
They are a hardy onion and will grow in nearly all 
conditions. Use them for salads, flavouring and 
garnish.
Sorrel
Rumex acetosa
This herb is often used in the same way as 
spinach. It is a perennial herb with plenty of tasty if 
somewhat lemony leaves. Use it raw for salads, mix 
some with other green vegetables while they are 
cooking or use it in this delicious sorrel and lentil 
soup.
Sorrel and Lentil Soup
Boil a cup of lentils in some stock with minced 
soup vegetables if desired. Cook until soft. Add 
some finely chopped sorrel leaves and cook for 
10 minutes more.
Winter Savoury
Saiureia hortensis
Winter savoury is a perennial herb that grows 
into an attractive low shrub and the leaves darken
in colour with the colder seasons. Use some leaves 
in stuffings and in salads, the peppery flavour will 
add some extra dash to both. Because it grows well 
in winter, it adds variety to what can be a dearth of 
tasty herbs.
Tarragon
Artemisia dracunculus
T here are two types of tarragon; French tarra­
gon and Russian tarragon. Both will spread 
throughout the garden once they are established. 
Grow them in spring and when they die back in 
winter, cut off the woody stalks.
Add tarragon to hot and cold sauces, stuffings 
and use it in fish dishes. Be less generous if the 
herb is dried.
Tarragon Vinegar
2 tablespoons tarragon 
1 clove garlic, chopped 
leaves 
2 cups warmed vinegar
Put all the ingredients in a covered jar. In 2 
weeks strain and bottle the vinegar.
Thyme
Thymus vulgaris
fhym e is a perennial herb that has become 
familiar in gardens. T here are many aromatic and 
variegated varieties available.
They grow easily from seed or suckers in late 
winter or spring. Cut back the bush in winter if it 
looks spindly.
Zucchini with Thyme
Slice some small zucchini thinly. Melt 1 table­
spoon of butter, add zucchini, 2 teaspoons 
chopped thyme (1 
teaspoon if dried) and 
season. Cover and cook gently until soft. Be 
careful not to burn the zucchini.

Indolent Kitchen Gardening
Indolent kitchen gardening? Doesn’t sound right?
In this book Libby Smith shows you how your garden can produce 
vegetables all through the year without blood, sweat and tears (though 
you must toil a little).
The answer lies in the mulch. Mulching is the basis; earthworms, 
compost, compatible plants and other organic management techniques 
are aids to success.
Oriented to a cool climate with some frosts, such as Canberra’s, 
Indolent Kitchen Gardening shows that you can have a reliable and 
regular crop and convert your harvest into simple and delicious food. If 
the back garden is your despair rather than your joy, this is the book for 
you.
